A transport is a server that connects to both a XMPP server and a non-XMPP server. By running a transport, I can use my Jabber client to talk to someone using, say, MSN Messenger. A transport typically connects once to the remote network for each JID that it sees as online. That is, it's your option 2 in reverse. This is because there is no special relationship between the transport and the non-XMPP network; the transport is simply acting as a bunch of regular clients. For this to work, XMPP clients must first register with the transport, giving login credentials for the remote network, and allowing the transport to view their presence. The only reason this has a chance of scaling better is that there can be many transports for the same remote network. For example, my Jabber server could run a transport to MSN, another Jabber server could run another one, and so on, each one providing connections for a different subset of XMPP users. While this spreads out the load on the Jabber side, and load balancing on your system may spread out the load as well, it still requires many connections between the two systems. In your case, because (I assume) the non-XMPP side of things is cooperating, putting a XMPP server interface on the non-XMPP server is likely your best bet. That server interface is best suited for managing the mapping between XMPP JIDs and how that JID will appear on its own network, rather than forcing XMPP users to register and so on.

Random access would create some additional challenges, but you could probably generate a binary search tree index to various offset points in the array that would allow you to get close to the desired location and then walk in from there. Note: The Huffman scheme still works well even if the data is random, as long as the 1/0 distribution is not perfectly even. That is, the less even the distribution, the better the compression ratio.

Look in wp-admin/js/theme-preview.js ","pontos":3,"sentimento":"positivo"},{"corpo":"Currying is a transformation that can be applied to functions to allow them to take one less argument than previously. For example, in F# you can define a function thus:- let f x y z = x + y + z Here function f takes parameters x, y and z and sums them together so:- f 1 2 3 Returns 6. From our definition we can can therefore define the curry function for f:- let curry f = fun x - f x Where 'fun x -> f x' is a lambda function equivilent to x => f(x) in C#. This function inputs the function you wish to curry and returns a function which takes a single argument and returns the specified function with the first argument set to the input argument. Using our previous example we can obtain a curry of f thus:- let curryf = curry f We can then do the following:- let f1 = curryf 1 Which provides us with a function f1 which is equivilent to f1 y z = 1 + y + z. This means we can do the following:- f1 2 3 Which returns 6. This process is often confused with 'partial function application' which can be defined thus:- let papply f x = f x Though we can extend it to more than one parameter, i.e.:- let papply2 f x y = f x y let papply3 f x y z = f x y z etc. A partial application will take the function and parameter(s) and return a function that requires one or more less parameters, and as the previous two examples show is implemented directly in the standard F# function definition so we could achieve the previous result thus:- let f1 = f 1 f1 2 3 Which will return a result of 6. In conclusion:- The difference between currying and partial function application is that:- Currying takes a function and provides a new function accepting a single argument, and returning the specified function with its first argument set to that argument. This allows us to represent functions with multiple parameters as a series of single argument functions. Example:- let f x y z = x + y + z let curryf = curry f let f1 = curryf 1 let f2 = curryf 2 f1 2 3 6 f2 1 3 6 Partial function application is more direct - it takes a function and one or more arguments and returns a function with the first n arguments set to the n arguments specified.

I never have to manually intervene, and I'll never lose another harddrive worth of data. If my computer dies, I'll always have a full bootable back-up that is no more than 24 hours old, and incremental back-ups no more than an hour old. Here are the details of how I do it. My only computer is a 160 gig MacBook running OSX Leopard. On my desk at work I have 2 external 500 gig harddrives. One of them is a single 500 gig partition called \"External\". The other has a 160 gig partition called \"Clone\" and a 340 gig partition called TimeMachine. TimeMachine runs whenever I'm at work, constantly backing up my \"in progress\" files (which are also committed to Version Control throughout the day). Every weekday at 12:05, SuperDuper! automatically copies my entire laptop harddrive to the \"Clone\" drive. If my laptop's harddrive dies, I can actually boot directly from the Clone drive and pick up work without missing a beat -- giving me some time to replace the drive (This HAS happened to me TWICE since setting this up!). (Technical Note: It actually only copies over whatever has changed since the previous weekday at 12:05... not the entire drive every time. Works like a charm.) At home I have a D-Link DNS-323, which is a 1TB (2x500 gig) Network Attached Storage device running a Mirrored RAID, so that everything on the first 500 gig drive is automatically copied to the second 500 gig drive. This way, you always have a backup, and it's fully automated. This little puppy has a built-in Dynamic DNS client, and FTP server. So, on my WRT54G router, I forward the FTP port (21) to my DNS-323, and leave its FTP server up. After the SuperDuper clone has been made, rSync runs and synchronizes my \"External\" drive with the DNS-323 at home, via FTP. That's it. Using 4 drives (2 external, 2 in the NAS) I have: 1) An always-bootable complete backup less than 24 hours old, Monday-Friday 2) A working-backup of all my in-progress files, which is never more than 30 minutes old, Monday-Friday (when I'm at work and connected to the external drives) 3) Access to all my MP3s (170GB) at documents at work on the \"External\" and at home on the NAS 4) Two complete backups of all my MP3s and documents on the NAS (External is original copy, both drives on NAS are mirrors via ChronoSync) Why do I do all of this? Because: 1) In 2000, I dropped a 40 gig harddrive 1 inch, and it cost me $2500 to get that data back. 2) In the past year, I've had to take my MacBook in for repair 4 times. One dead harddrive, two dead motherboards, and a dead webcam. On the 4th time, they replaced my MacBook with a newer better one at no charge, and I haven't had a problem since. Thanks to my daily backups, I didn't lose any work, or productivity. If I hadn't had them, though, all my work would have been gone, along with my MP3s, and my writing, and all the photos of my trips to Peru, Croatia, England, France, Greece, Netherlands, Italy, and all my family photos.

In C++ you don't have to specify a class or an interface for the generic type. That's why you can create truly generic functions and classes, with the caveat of a looser typing. template typename T T sum(T a, T b) { return a + b; } The method above adds two objects of the same type, and can be used for any type T that has the \"+\" operator available. In Java you have to specify a type if you want to call methods on the objects passed, something like: T extends Something T sum(T a, T b) { return a.add ( b ); } In C++ generic functions/classes can only be defined in headers, since the compiler generates different functions for different types (that it's invoked with). So the compilation is slower. In Java the compilation doesn't have a major penalty, but Java uses a technique called \"erasure\" where the generic type is erased at runtime, so at runtime Java is actually calling ... Something sum(Something a, Something b) { return a.add ( b ); } So generic programming in Java is not really useful, it's only a little syntactic sugar to help with the new foreach construct.

Chris Smith (guy on the F# team at MS) has an article called 'F# in 20 minutes' - part 1 and part 2. Note you have to be careful as the latest CTP of F# (version 1.9.6.0) has some seriously breaking changes compared to previous versions, so some examples/tutorials out there might not work without modification. Here's a quick run-down of some cool stuff, maybe I can give you a few hints here myself which are clearly very brief and probably not great but hopefully gives you something to play with!:- First note - most examples on the internet will assume 'lightweight syntax' is turned on. To achieve this use the following line of code:- #light This prevents you from having to insert certain keywords that are present for OCaml compatibility and also having to terminate each line with semicolons. Note that using this syntax means indentation defines scope. This will become clear in later examples, all of which rely on lightweight syntax being switched on. If you're using the interactive mode you have to terminate all statements with double semi-colons, for example:- #light;; let f x y = x + y;; val f : int - int - int f 1 2;; val it : int = 3 Note that interactive mode returns a 'val' result after each line. This gives important information about the definitions we are making, for example 'val f : int -> int -> int' indicates that a function which takes two ints returns an int. Note that only in interactive do we need to terminate lines with semi-colons, when actually defining F# code we are free of that :-) You define functions using the 'let' keyword. This is probably the most important keyword in all of F# and you'll be using it a lot. For example:- let sumStuff x y = x + y let sumStuffTuple (x, y) = x + y We can call these functions thus:- sumStuff 1 2 3 sumStuffTuple (1, 2) 3 Note there are two different ways of defining functions here - you can either separate parameters by whitespace or specify parameters in 'tuples' (i.e. values in parentheses separated by commas). The difference is that we can use 'partial function application' to obtain functions which take less than the required parameters using the first approach, and not with the second. E.g.:- let sumStuff1 = sumStuff 1 sumStuff 2 3 Note we are obtaining a function from the expression 'sumStuff 1'. When we can pass around functions just as easily as data that is referred to as the language having 'first class functions', this is a fundamental part of any functional language such as F#. Pattern matching is pretty darn cool, it's basically like a switch statement on steroids (yeah I nicked that phrase from another F#-ist :-). You can do stuff like:- let someThing x = match x with | 0 - \"zero\" | 1 - \"one\" | 2 - \"two\" | x when x 0 - \"negative = \" + x.ToString() | _ when x%2 = 0 - \"greater than two but even\" | _ - \"greater than two but odd\" Note we use the '_' symbol when we want to match on something but the expression we are returning does not depend on the input. We can abbreviate pattern matching using if, elif, and else statements as required:- let negEvenOdd x = if x 0 then \"neg\" elif x % 2 = 0 then \"even\" else \"odd\" F# lists (which are implemented as linked lists underneath) can be manipulated thus:- let l1 = [1;2;3] l1.[0] 1 let l2 = [1 .. 10] List.length l2 10 let squares = [for i in 1..10 - i * i] squares [1; 4; 9; 16; 25; 36; 49; 64; 81; 100] let square x = x * x;; let squares2 = List.map square [1..10] squares2 [1; 4; 9; 16; 25; 36; 49; 64; 81; 100] let evenSquares = List.filter (fun x - x % 2 = 0) squares evenSqares [4; 16; 36; 64; 100] Note the List.map function 'maps' the square function on to the list from 1 to 10, i.e. applies the function to each element. List.filter 'filters' a list by only returning values in the list that pass the predicate function provided. Also note the 'fun x -> f' syntax - this is the F# lambda. Note that throughout we have not defined any types - the F# compiler/interpreter 'infers' types, i.e. works out what you want from usage. For example:- let f x = \"hi \" + x Here the compiler/interpreter will determine x is a string since you're performing an operation which requires x to be a string. It also determines the return type will be string as well. When there is ambiguity the compiler makes assumptions, for example:- let f x y = x + y Here x and y could be a number of types, but the compiler defaults to int. If you want to define types you can using type annotation:- let f (x:string) y = x + y Also note that we have had to enclose x:string in parentheses, we often have to do this to separate parts of a function definition. Two really useful and heavily used operators in F# are the pipe forward and function composition operators |> and >> respectively. We define |> thus:- let (| ) x f = f x Note that you can define operators in F#, this is pretty cool :-). This allows you to write things in a clearer way, e.g.:- [1..10] | List.map (fun x - x * x) | List.filter (fun x - x % 2 = 0) Will allow you to obtain the first 10 even squares. That is clearer than:- List.filter (fun x - x % 2 = 0) (List.map (fun x - x * x) [1..10]) Well, at least I think so :-) Function composition defined by the >> operator is defined as follows:- let ( ) f g x = g(f(x)) I.e. you forward-pipe an operation only the parameter of the first function remains unspecified. This is useful as you can do the following:- let mapFilter = List.map (fun x - x * x) List.filter (fun x - x % 2 = 0) Here mapFilter will accept a list an input and return the list filtered as before. It's an abbreviated version of:- let mapFilter = l | List.map (fun x - x * x) | List.filter (fun x - x % 2 = 0) If we want to write recursive functions we have to define the function as recursive by placing 'rec' after the let. Examples below. Some cool stuff:- Factorial let rec fact x = if x = 1 then 1 else x * fact (x-1) nth Fibonacci Number let rec fib n = if n = 1 then n else fib (n-1) + fib (n-2) FizzBuzz let (/%) x y = x % y = 0 let fb = function | x when x /% 15 - \"FizzBuzz\" | x when x /% 3 - \"Fizz\" | x when x /% 5 - \"Buzz\" | x - x.ToString() [1..100] | List.map (fb printfn \"%s\") Anyway that's a very brief overview, hopefully it helps a little!!

You can write functional code in any language that supports first-class functions, but there are some languages, like Haskell, which do not allow you to change state. In fact, you're not supposed to make any side effects (like printing out text) at all - which sounds like it could be completely useless. Haskell instead employs a different approach to IO: monads. These are objects that contain the desired IO operation to be executed by your interpreter's toplevel. At any other level they are simply objects in the system.

They use side effect free functions as a basic building block in the language. This enables lots of things and makes a lot of things more difficult (or in most cases different from what people are used to) One of the biggest advantages with functional programming is that the order of execution of side effect free functions is not important. For example in erlang this is used to enable concurrency in a very transparent way. And because functions in functional languages behave very similar to mathematical functions it's easy to translate those into functional languages. In some cases this can make code more readable. Traditionally one of the big disadvantages of functional programming was also the lack of side effects. It's very difficult to write useful software without IO, but IO is hard to implement without side-effects in functions. So most people never got more out of functional programming than calculating a single output from a single input. In modern mixed paradigm languages like F# or scala this is easier. Lots of modern languages have elements from functional programming languages. C# 3.0 has a lot functional programming features and you can do functional programming in python too. I think the reasons for the popularity of functional programming is mostly because of two reasons.

For example, if read load is high and content doesn't change too often, it might be better to emphasise caching and introduce dedicated front-end caches, e.g. Squid to avoid un-needed database reads, although you will need to consider how to maintain cache coherency, typically in the application. On the other hand, if content changes reasonably often, then you will probably prefer a more spread-out solution; introduce a few more application servers and database slaves to help mitigate the effects, and use object caching, such as memcached to avoid hitting the database for the less volatile content. For most sites, this is probably enough, although if you do become a global phenomenon, then you'll probably want to start considering having hardware in regional data centres, and using tricks such as geographic load balancing to direct visitors to the closest \"cluster\". By that point, you'll probably be in a position to hire engineers who can really fine-tune things. Probably the most valuable scaling advice I can think of would be to avoid worrying about it all far too soon; concentrate on developing a service people are going to want to use, and making the application reasonably robust. Some easy early optimisations are to make sure your database design is fairly solid, and that indexes are set up so you're not doing anything painfully crazy; also, make sure the application emits cache-control headers that direct browsers on how to cache the data. Doing this sort of work early on in the design can yield benefits later, especially when you don't have to rework the entire thing to deal with cache coherency issues. The second most valuable piece of advice I want to put across is that you shouldn't assume what works for some other web site will work for you; check your logs, run some analysis on your traffic and profile your application - see where your bottlenecks are and resolve them.

The title asks about disposal, but then says that they want memory back immediately. .Net is managed, which means that when you write .Net apps you don't need to worry about memory directly, the cost is that you don't have direct control over memory either. .Net decides when it's best to clean up and free memory, not you as the .Net coder. The is a way to tell .Net that you're done with something, but it won't actually free up the memory until it's the best time to do so. Basically .Net will actually collect the memory back when it's easiest for it to do so - it's very good at deciding when. Unless you're writing something very memory intensive you normally don't need to overrule it (this is part of the reason games aren't often written in .Net yet - they need complete control) In .Net you can use to force it to immediately, but that is almost always bad practise. If .Net hasn't cleaned it up yet that means it isn't a particularly good time for it to do so. picks up the objects that .Net identifies as done with. If you haven't disposed an object that needs it .Net may decide to keep that object. This means that is only effective if you correctly implement your disposable instances. is not a replacement for correctly using IDisposable. So Dispose and memory are not directly related, but they don't need to be. Correctly disposing will make your .Net apps more efficient and therefore use less memory though. 99% of the time in .Net the following is best practice: Rule 1: If you don't deal with anything unmanaged or that implements then don't worry about Dispose. Rule 2: If you have a local variable that implements IDisposable make sure that you get rid of it in the current scope: //using is best practice using( SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(\"my con str\" ) ) { //do stuff } //this is what 'using' actually compiles to: SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(\"my con str\" ) ; try { //do stuff } finally { con.Dispose(); } Rule 3: If a class has a property or member variable that implements IDisposable then that class should implement IDisposable too. In that class's Dispose method you can also dispose of your IDisposable properties: //rather basic example public sealed MyClass : IDisposable { //this connection is disposable public SqlConnection MyConnection { get; set; } //make sure this gets rid of it too public Dispose() { //if we still have a connection dispose it if( MyConnection != null ) MyConnection.Dispose(); //note that the connection might have already been disposed //always write disposals so that they can be called again } } This isn't really complete, which is why the example is sealed. Inheriting classes may need to observe the next rule... Rule 4: If a class uses an unmanaged resource then implement IDispose and add a finaliser. .Net can't do anything with the unmanaged resource, so now we are talking about memory. If you don't clean it up you can get a memory leak. The Dispose method needs to deal with both managed and unmanaged resources. The finaliser is a safety catch - it ensures that if someone else creates and instance of your class and fails to dispose it the 'dangerous' unmanaged resources can still be cleaned up by .Net. ~MyClass() { //calls a protected method //the false tells this method //not to bother with managed //resources this.Dispose(false); } public void Dispose() { //calls the same method //passed true to tell it to //clean up managed and unmanaged this.Dispose(true); //as dispose has been correctly //called we don't need the //'backup' finaliser GC.SuppressFinalize(this); } Finally this overload of Dispose that takes a boolean flag: protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing) { //check this hasn't been called already //remember that Dispose can be called again if (!disposed) { //this is passed true in the regular Dispose if (disposing) { // Dispose managed resources here. } //both regular Dispose and the finaliser //will hit this code // Dispose unmanaged resources here. } disposed = true; } Note that once this is all in place other managed code creating an instance of your class can just treat it like any other IDisposable (Rules 2 and 3).

If a class uses unmanaged resources, those should be cleaned up in your Dispose(bool) function. This same function should only cleanup managed resources when bool is true. Adding a finalizer adds a complexity cost to using your object as each time you create a new instance it must also be placed on the finalization queue, which is checked each time the GC runs a collection cycle. Effectively, this means that your object survives one cycle/generation longer than it should so the finalizer can be run. The finalizer should not be thought of as a \"safety net\". The GC will only run a collection cycle when it determines that there is not enough available memory in the Gen0 heap to perform the next allocation, unless you \"help\" it by calling GC.Collect() to force an out-of-band collection. The bottom line is that, no matter what, the GC only knows how to release resources by calling the Dispose method (and possibly the finalizer if one is implemented). It is up to that method to \"do the right thing\" and clean up any unmanaged resources used and instruct any other managed resources to call their Dispose method. It is very efficient at what it does and can self-optimize to a large extent as long as it isn't helped by out-of-band collection cycles.

If using multiple exit points during input validation or resource allocation, I try to put all the 'error-exits' very visibly at the top of the function. Both the Spartan Programming article of the \"SSDSLPedia\" and the single function exit point article of the \"Portland Pattern Repository's Wiki\" have some insightful arguments around this. Also, of course, there is this post to consider. If you really want a single exit-point (in any non-exception-enabled language) for example in order to release resources in one single place, I find the careful application of goto to be good; see for example this rather contrived example (compressed to save screen real-estate): int f(int y) { int value = -1; void *data = NULL; if (y 0) goto clean; if ((data = malloc(123)) == NULL) goto clean; /* More code */ value = 1; clean: free(data); return value; } Personally I, in general, dislike arrow programming more than I dislike multiple exit-points, although both are useful when applied correctly. The best, of course, is to structure your program to require neither. Breaking down your function into multiple chunks usually help :) Although when doing so, I find I end up with multiple exit points anyway as in this example, where some larger function has been broken down into several smaller functions: int g(int y) { value = 0; if ((value = g0(y, value)) == -1) return -1; if ((value = g1(y, value)) == -1) return -1; return g2(y, value); } Depending on the project or coding guidelines, most of the boiler-plate code could be replaced by macros. As a side note, breaking it down this way makes the functions g0, g1 ,g2 very easy to test individually. Obviously, in an OO and exception-enabled language, I wouldn't use if-statements like that (or at all, if I could get away with it with little enough effort), and the code would be much more plain. And non-arrowy. And most of the non-final returns would probably be exceptions.

The boundaries between the asymmetric, moderate, and symmetric regions will depend on the time required by the various algorithms balanced against the space they need, where the relative value of time versus space would be an adjustable parameter. The space needed for Huffman coding is a function of the symmetry, and I'll profile that with testing. Also, I'll test all three methods to determine the time requirements of my implementation. It's possible (and actually I'm hoping) that the middle compression method will always be better than the list or the bit array or both.

The real problem with the proposed pattern shown here is mutability. The problem is once you pass an object reference out containing non-final, public fields. Anything else with that reference is free to modify those fields. You no longer have any control over the state of that object. (Think what would happen if Strings were mutable.) It gets bad when that object is an important part of the internal state of another, you've just exposed internal implementation. To prevent this, a copy of the object must be returned instead. This works, but can cause massive GC pressure from tons of single-use copies created. If you have public fields, consider making the class read-only. Add the fields as parameters to the constructor, and mark the fields final. Otherwise make sure you're not exposing internal state, and if you need to construct new instances for a return value, make sure it won't be called excessively.

","pontos":8,"sentimento":"negativo"},{"corpo":"To help facilitate understanding of closures it might be useful to examine how they might be implemented in a procedural language. This explanation will follow a simplistic implementation of closures in Scheme. To start, I must introduce the concept of a namespace. When you enter a command into a Scheme interpreter, it must evaluate the various symbols in the expression and obtain their value. Example: (define x 3) (define y 4) (+ x y) returns 7 The define expressions store the value 3 in the spot for x and the value 4 in the spot for y. Then when we call (+ x y), the interpreter looks up the values in the namespace and is able to perform the operation and return 7. However, in Scheme there are expressions that allow you to temporarily override the value of a symbol. Here's an example: (define x 3) (define y 4) (let ((x 5)) (+ x y)) returns 9 x returns 3 What the let keyword does is introduces a new namespace with x as the value 5. You will notice that it's still able to see that y is 4, making the sum returned to be 9. You can also see that once the expression has ended x is back to being 3. In this sense, x has been temporarily masked by the local value. Procedural and object-oriented languages have a similar concept. Whenever you declare a variable in a function that has the same name as a global variable you get the same effect. How would we implement this? A simple way is with a linked list - the head contains the new value and the tail contains the old namespace. When you need to look up a symbol, you start at the head and work your way down the tail. Now let's skip to the implementation of first-class functions for the moment. More or less, a function is a set of instructions to execute when the function is called culminating in the return value. When we read in a function, we can store these instructions behind the scenes and run them when the function is called. (define x 3) (define (plus-x y) (+ x y)) (let ((x 5)) (plus-x 4)) returns ? We define x to be 3 and plus-x to be its parameter, y, plus the value of x. Finally we call plus-x in an environment where x has been masked by a new x, this one valued 5. If we merely store the operation, (+ x y), for the function plus-x, since we're in the context of x being 5 the result returned would be 9. This is what's called dynamic scoping. However, Scheme, Common Lisp, and many other languages have what's called lexical scoping - in addition to storing the operation (+ x y) we also store the namespace at that particular point. That way, when we're looking up the values we can see that x, in this context, is really 3. This is a closure. (define x 3) (define (plus-x y) (+ x y)) (let ((x 5)) (plus-x 4)) returns 7 In summary, we can use a linked list to store the state of the namespace at the time of function definition, allowing us to access variables from enclosing scopes, as well as providing us the ability to locally mask a variable without affecting the rest of the program.

One solution is to keep every project/package/etc. as its own bare repository (i.e., without working tree) under a blessed hierarchy, like: /repos/a.git /repos/b.git /repos/c.git Once a few conventions have been established, it becomes trivial to apply administrative operations (backup, packing, web publishing) to the complete hierarchy, which serves a role not entirely dissimilar to \"monolithic\" SVN repositories. Working with these repositories also becomes somewhat similar to SVN workflows, with the addition that one can use local commits and branches: svn checkout -- git clone svn update -- git pull svn commit -- git push You can have multiple remotes in each working clone, for the ease of synchronizing between the multiple parties: $ cd ~/dev $ git clone /repos/foo.git # or the one from github, ... $ cd foo $ git remote add github ... $ git remote add memorystick ...

The notifyAll() method is actually used in most other cases. Strictly, it is required to notify waiters of a condition that could allow multiple waiters to proceed.

An example would be a set of threads waiting for a certain task to finish; once the task has finished, all waiting threads can continue with their business. In such a case you would use notifyAll() to wake up all waiting threads at the same time. Another case, for example mutually exclusive locking, only one of the waiting threads can do something useful after being notified (in this case acquire the lock).

First a little more clarification: The app is written in C# (2.0+) and uses ADO.NET to talk to SQL Server 2005. The mirror setup is two W2k3 servers hosting the Principal and the Mirror plus a third server hosting an express instance as a monitor. The nice thing about this is a failover is all but transparent to the app using the database, it will throw an error for some connections but fundamentally everything will carry on nicely. Yes we're getting the odd false positive but the whole point is to have the system carry on working with the least amount of fuss and mirror does deliver this very nicely. Further, the issue is not with serious server failure - that's usually a bit more obvious but with a failover for other reasons (c.f. the false positives above) as we do have a couple of things that can't, for various reasons, fail over and in any case so we can see if we can identify the circumstance where we get false positives. So, given the above, simply checking the status of the boxes is not quite enough and chasing through the event log is probably overly complex - the answer is, as it turns out, fairly simple: sp_helpserver The first column returned by sp_helpserver is the server name.

You can use the task manager to tell windows what CPU(s) your program should be allowed to run on. Normally this is only useful for troubleshooting legacy programs which have broken implementations of multi-threading. To do this, Run task manager Find your process in the window. Right click and choose Tick the checkboxes next to the CPU's you want to allow your application to run on. Windows will then only schedule threads from that process onto those particular CPU's If I recall correctly, windows will 'remember' these settings for subsequent times your process is run, but please don't quote me on that - run some tests yourself :-) You can also do this programatically in .NET after your program has launched using using the System.Diagnostics.Process.ProcessorAffinity property, but I don't think it will 'remember' the settings, so there will always be a short period in which your app is run on whichever CPU windows sees fit. I don't know how to do this in java sorry. Note: This applies at the entire process level. If you set affinity for CPU0 only, and then launch 50 threads, all 50 of those threads will run on CPU0, and CPU1, 2, 3, etc will sit around doing nothing. Just to reiterate the point, this is primarily useful for troubleshooting broken legacy software. If your software is not broken, you really shouldn't mess with any of these settings, and let windows decide the best CPU(s) to run your program on, so it can take the rest of the system's performance into account. As for the 'shared memory' model, it works the same, but there are more things that can go subtly wrong when your app is running on multiple CPU's as opposed to just timeslices on a single one. For an eye-opening example, read this ridiculousfish article about CPU's and Memory Barriers. It's aimed at OSX development on PowerPC, but general enough that it should apply everywhere.

I've used lucene.net as a general database indexer, so what I got back was basically DB id's (to indexed email messages), and I've also use it to get back enough info to populate search results or such without touching the database. It's worked great in both cases, tho the SQL can get a little slow, as you pretty much have to get an ID, select an ID etc. We got around this by making a temp table (with just the ID row in it) and bulk-inserting from a file (which was the output from lucene) then joining to the message table. Was a lot quicker. Lucene isn't perfect, and you do have to think a little outside the relational database box, because it TOTALLY isn't one, but it's very very good at what it does. Worth a look, and, I'm told, doesn't have the \"oops, sorry, you need to rebuild your index again\" problems that MS SQL's FTI does. BTW, we were dealing with 20-50million emails (and around 1 million unique attachments), totaling about 20GB of lucene index I think, and 250+GB of SQL database + attachments. Performance was fantastic, to say the least - just make sure you think about, and tweak, your merge factors (when it merges index segments). There is no issue in having more than one segment, but there can be a BIG problem if you try to merge two segments which have 1mil items in each, and you have a watcher thread which kills the process if it takes too long.....

Children are all different - some are quick learners, some aren't. In particular, some have better literacy skills than others, and that definitely makes a difference to the speed at which they'll pick up programming. I bet that most of us here, as professional computer programmers and the kind of people who read and post to forums for fun, learnt to read at a pretty young age. For those kinds of children, and if it's your own child who you can teach one-on-one, you could do worse than JavaScript - it has the advantage that you can do real stuff with it right away, and the edit-test cycle is simply hitting \"refresh\" in the browser. It gets confusing when you start to run in to how JavaScript does everything asynchronously, and is tricky to debug, but for a bright child under close tuition these problems can be overcome. LEGO Mindstorms is definitely up there at the top of the list. Most schools now super-glue the bricks together to create pre-made models that can't have bits nicked off of them, but this shouldn't be a problem at home. Over on the Times Educational Supplement site (website forum for the UK's weekly teaching newspaper), the \"what programming language is best for children?\" topic comes up pretty regularly. Lots of recommendations over there for Scratch as an alternative to Mindstorms - bit more freedom than Mindstorms, again probably better for the brighter student who could also be given a soldering iron. I've found that slower pupils can still have problems with Mindstorms, even though the programming environment is \"graphical\" - there's still a lot going on on screen, and there's a fair bit to remember (this was an older version, mind - haven't tried the snazzy new one yet). In my experience, the best all-round introduction to programming is probably still LOGO - actually a considerably more powerful language than most people give it credit for. The original Mindstorms book by Seymour Papert (nothing to do with LEGO - they nicked the title of the book for their product), one of the originators of LOGO, is the canonical reference for teaching programming to children as a \"thinking skill\" and for the concept of Constructionism in learning. We've had classes of 7 or 8 year-olds programming LOGO. Note that we aren't aiming to make them \"software developers\", that's a career path they can decide on at some point post-16. At a young age we're trying to get them to think of \"computer programming\" as just another tool - how to set out a problem to be solved by a computer, in the same way they might use a mind map to help them organise and remember stuff for an exam.

It also reduces storage to O(sqrt(N)) instead of O(N), which helps both in terms of the largest N, paging, and bandwidth. For medium values of N (1e8 to 1e12), the primes up to sqrt(N) can be found quite quickly, and after that you should be able to parallelise the subsequent search on the CPU quite easily. On my single core machine, the wheel approach finds primes up to 1e9 in 28s, whereas your sieve (after moving the sqrt out of the loop) takes 86s - the improvement is due to the wheel; the inversion means you can handle N larger than 2^32 but makes it slower. Code can be found here. You could parallelise the output of the results from the naive sieve after you go past sqrt(N) too, as the bit array is not modified after that point; but once you are dealing with N large enough for it to matter the array size is too big for ints.

In Windows 32 bit this is around 2gb (not specifically heap but total amount of memory per process). It just happens that Java happens to make the default smaller (presumably so that the programmer can't create programs that have runaway memory allocation without running into this problem and having to examine exactly what they are doing). So this given there are several approaches you could take to either determine what amount of memory you need or to reduce the amount of memory you are using. One common mistake with garbage collected languages such as Java or C# is to keep around references to objects that you no longer are using, or allocating many objects when you could reuse them instead. As long as objects have a reference to them they will continue to use heap space as the garbage collector will not delete them. In this case you can use a Java memory profiler to determine what methods in your program are allocating large number of objects and then determine if there is a way to make sure they are no longer referenced, or to not allocate them in the first place. One option which I have used in the past is \"JMP\" http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/. If you determine that you are allocating these objects for a reason and you need to keep around references (depending on what you are doing this might be the case), you will just need to increase the max heap size when you start the program. However, once you do the memory profiling and understand how your objects are getting allocated you should have a better idea about how much memory you need. In general if you can't guarantee that your program will run in some finite amount of memory (perhaps depending on input size) you will always run into this problem. Only after exhausting all of this will you need to look into caching objects out to disk etc. At this point you should have a very good reason to say \"I need Xgb of memory\" for something and you can't work around it by improving your algorithms or memory allocation patterns.

The problem wasn't with databinding to a DataGridView in general, or with the implementation of a DataGridViewComboBoxColumn - as the people who have answered already rightly say, that is well documented on the web. The problem I've been trying to solve is with the refresh of properties that are drilling down through relationships. In my orders example, when I change the value of the \"Product\" column, the \"Product Type\" column is not being updated - even though in the code I am setting the property and firing the NotifyPropertyChanged event. (In debug I go to all the right places) After a lot of poking around I realised that this was not even working when I directly set the \"Product Type\" property of datasource, rather that setting it in the \"Product\" setter. The other thing that I believe has me back on the right track is that when I provide a mocked dataccess layer, created in the main form, everything works fine. Also, when I copy the IList made by nHibernate to a IBindingList - everything again appears fine. So the problem is I think with threading and the NotifyPropertyChanged events being lost when using certain datasources, in certain ways (wish I could be more definitive than that!) I'm going to keep researching better ways of resolving this than copying the IList to the IBindingList - maybe I need to learn about thread marshalling. Edit I've now developed a solution that solves the issue and think I understand what was confusing me - basically it appears that anything but basic property databinding doesn't play nicely for lists that aren't derived from BindingList - as soon as I was trying to databind to properties that fired chained NotifyPropertyChanged events, things went haywire and I my events got lost. The data access solution I have now is using a variation of the Rob Conery IRepository pattern, returning my collections to be bound as a custom class I made, a SortableBindingLazyList that derives from BindingList, implements the Sort Core methods and also stores its internal list as a query, delaying the list materialisation.

The Mac OS X system is really cool this way. If you specify that a job should be launched on-demand via a secure Unix-domain socket, will actually create the socket itself with appropriate permissions, and advertise its location via the environment variable named in the job's property list. The job, when started, will actually be passed a file descriptor to the socket by when it does a simple check-in.

Sometimes DataSets or DataTables are more suited, like if it really is pretty light business logic, flat hierarchy of entities/records, or featuring some versioning capabilities. Custom object collections shine when you want to implement a deep hierarchy/graph of objects that cannot be efficiently represented in flat 2D tables. What you can demonstrate is a large graph of objects and getting certain events to propagate down the correct branches without invoking inappropriate objects in other branches. That way it is not necessary to loop or Select through each and every DataTable just to get the child records. For example, in a project I got involved in two and half years ago, there was a UI module that is supposed to display questions and answer controls in a single WinForms DataGrid (to be more specific, it was Infragistics' UltraGrid). Some more tricky requirements The answer control for a question can be anything - text box, check box options, radio button options, drop-down lists, or even to pop up a custom dialog box that may pull more data from a web service. Depending on what the user answered, it can trigger more sub-questions to appear directly under the parent question. If a different answer is given later, it should expose another set of sub-questions (if any) related to that answer. The original implementation was written entirely in DataSets, DataTables, and arrays. The amount of looping through the hundreds of rows for multiple tables was purely mind-bending. It did not help the programmer came from a C++ background attempting to ref everything (hello, objects living in the heap use reference variables, like pointers!). Nobody, not even the originally programmer, could explain why the code is doing what it does. I came into the scene more than six months after this, and it was stil flooded with bugs. No wonder the 2nd-generation developer I took over from decided to quit. Two months of tying to fix the chaotic mess, I took it upon myself to redesign the entire module into an object-oriented graph to solve this problem. yeap, complete with abstract classes (to render different answer control on a grid cell depending on question type), delegates and eventing. The end result was a 2D dataGrid binded to a deep hierarchy of questions, naturally sorted according to the parent-child arrangement. When a parent question's answer changed, it would raise an event to the children questions and they would automatically show/hide their rows in the grid according to the parent's answer. Only question objects down that path were affected. The UI responsiveness of this solution compared to the old method was by orders of magnitude.

My application code has no dependencies on the framework, it is highly decoupled, reusable and testable. One of the nicest features of Mate is the declarative configuration, essentially you wire up your application in using tags in what is called an event map -- basically a list of events that your application generates, and what actions to take when they occur. The event map gives a good overview of what your application does. Mate uses Flex' own event mechanism, it does not invent its own like most other frameworks. You can dispatch an event from anywhere in the view hierarchy and have it bubble up to the framework automatically, instead of having to have a direct line, like Cairngorms CairngormEventDispatcher or PureMVC's notification system. Mate also uses a form of dependency injection (leveraging bindings) that makes it possible to connect your models to your views without either one knowing about the other. This is probably the most powerful feature of the framework. In my view none of the other Flex application frameworks come anywhere near Mate. However, these are the contenders and why I consider them to be less useful: PureMVC actively denies you many of the benefits of Flex (for example bindings and event bubbling) in order for the framework to be portable -- a doubious goal in my view. It is also over-engineered, and as invasive as they come. Every single part of your application depends on the framework. However, PureMVC isn't terrible, just not a very good fit for Flex. An alternative is FlexMVCS, an effort to make PureMVC more suitable for Flex (unfortunately there's no documentation yet, just source). Cairngorm is a bundle of anti-patterns that lead to applications that are tightly coupled to global variables. Nuff said (but if you're interested, here are some more of my thoughts, and here too). Swiz is a framework inspired by the Spring framework for Java and Cairngorm (trying to make up for the worst parts of the latter). It provides a dependency injection container and uses metadata to enable auto-wiring of dependencies. It is interesting, but a little bizzare in that goes to such lengths to avoid the global variables of Cairngorm by using dependency injection but then uses a global variable for central event dispatching.

For example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a 'doSomething' method on it if one exists. Java's static typing system isn't really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething' and then call it if you want to. So, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo) : Method method = foo.getClass().getMethod(\"doSomething\", null); method.invoke(foo, null); One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the @Test annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test. There are some good reflection examples to get you started at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html And finally, yes, the concepts are pretty much similar in other statically types languages which support reflection (like C#). In dynamically typed languages, the use case described above is less necessary (since the compiler will allow any method to be called on any object, failing at runtime if it does not exist), but the second case of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common.

In C# for example you can load an assembly (a .dll) in runtime an examine it, navigating through the classes and taking actions according to what you found. It also let you create an instance of a class on runtime, invoke its method, etc. Where can it be useful? Is not useful everytime but for concrete situations.

Lot's of object relational mappers use reflection to be able to instantiate objects from databases without knowing in advance what objects they're going to use.

More advanced uses lets you list and call methods, constructors, etc. Reflection is important since it lets you write programs that do not have to \"know\" everything at compile time, making them more dynamic, since they can be tied together at runtime. The code can be written against known interfaces, but the actual classes to be used can be instantiated using reflection from configuration files. Lots of modern frameworks uses reflection extensively for this very reason.

The /dev/random driver gathers environmental noise from various non-deterministic sources including, but not limited to, inter-keyboard timings and inter-interrupt timings that occur within the operating system environment. The noise data is sampled and combined with a CRC-like mixing function into a continuously updating ``entropy-pool''. Random bit strings are obtained by taking a MD5 hash of the contents of this pool. The one-way hash function distills the true random bits from pool data and hides the state of the pool from adversaries. The /dev/random routine maintains an estimate of true randomness in the pool and decreases it every time random strings are requested for use. When the estimate goes down to zero, the routine locks and waits for the occurrence of non-deterministic events to refresh the pool. The /dev/random kernel module also provides another interface, /dev/urandom, that does not wait for the entropy-pool to re-charge and returns as many bytes as requested. As a result /dev/urandom is considerably faster at generation compared to /dev/random which is used only when very high quality randomness is desired.

To support this principle, you should try and make sure your markup is as legible as possible - class and id tags in particular should relate as much as possible to their intended content. In other words, try to use your tags to describe the kind of content they will have. For example, \"Sub-navigation\", \"content\" etc. The aim is to provide markup that someone can pickup having not looked at before and get a sense of the logical structure of the document. Also, try to avoid the addition of markup that is purely to achieve a visual effect. But bear in mind that any website that requires even slightly sophisticated styling is unlikely to be able avoid non-semantic markup, due to weaknesses in current implementations of CSS and browser-compatibility issues. Regarding CSS files: Many people divide their css up into sections using comments, separating them into functional or structural areas. So you might have a section for your header, your footer, or typography and so on. Others take this further and split css across files, having one for typography, one for layout etc. However, this can according to Yslow! can have a negative impact on page loading, due to increased http requests.

An memory leak is when you attach to an resource and do not let it go, that you can do both in managed and in unmanaged coding. Regarding .net, and other programming tools, there have been ideas about garbage collecting, and other ways of minimizing situations that will make your application leak. But the best method of preventing memory leaks is that you need to understand your underlying memory model, and how things works, on the platform you are using. Believing that GC and other magic will clean up your mess is the short way to memory leaks, and will be difficult to find later. When coding unmanaged, you normally make sure to clean up, you know that the resources you take hold of, will be your responsibility to clean up, not the janitors. In .net on the other hand, lot of people think that GC will clean up everything.

There are philosophical debates about what randomness means. Here, I will mean \"indistinguishable in every respect from a uniform(0,1) iid distribution over the samples drawn\" I am totally ignoring philosophical questions of what random is. Knuth volume 2 has an analysis where he attempts to create a random number generator as you suggest, and then analyzes why it fails, and what true random processes are. Volume 2 examines RNGs in detail. The others recommend you using random physical processes to generate random numbers. However, as we can see in the Espo/vt interaction, these processes can have subtle periodic elements and other non-random elements, in part due to outside factors with deterministic behavior. In general, it is best never to assume randomness, but always to test for it, and you usually can correct for such artifacts if you are aware of them. It is possible to create an \"infinite\" stream of bits that appears completely random, deterministically. Unfortunately, such approaches grow in memory with the number of bits asked for (as they would have to, to avoid repeating cycles), so their scope is limited. In practice, you are almost always better off using a pseudo-random number generator with known properties. The key numbers to look for is the phase-space dimension (which is roughly offset between samples you can still count on being uniformally distributed) and the bit-width (the number of bits in each sample which are uniformally random with respect to each other), and the cycle size (the number of samples you can take before the distribution starts repeating). However, since random numbers from a given generator are deterministically in a known sequence, your procedure might be exposed by someone searching through the generator and finding an aligning sequence. Therefore, you can likely avoid your distribution being immediately recognized as coming from a particular random number generator if you maintain two generators. From the first, you sample i, and then map this uniformally over one to n, where n is at most the phase dimension. Then, in the second you sample i times, and return the ith result. This will reduce your cycle size to (orginal cycle size/n) in the worst case, but for that cycle will still generate uniform random numbers, and do so in a way that makes the search for alignment exponential in n. It will also reduce the independent phase length. Don't use this method unless you understand what reduced cycle and independent phase lengths mean to your application.

As a bonus, it comes with code rush and Refactor, which once you get the hang of them, they help save time (plus, it makes your code look pretty...). I'd say their support is pretty good - I've found a couple of bugs in the past which I've had a reply to within 24 hours, which states they will fix the issue in the next release. One gotcha (if you could call it that) is that most of their components have a 'Properties' property which is where a lot of common properties get set. I find that a little annoying to use because they need a few more clicks or keypresses to get to, but at least you can get the job done (they tend to put things like input masks in here - regex, numerical etc). One think that took a bit of getting used to is with the XtraGrid and Treelist, which if you want to do some custom display for specific cells, you have to hook up an event that fires before the cell is displayed.

As far as I can see the vast majority of the time you should be using classes and the JITter should guarantee a good level of performance. structs have 'value type semantics', so will pass by value rather than by reference. We can see this difference in behaviour in the following example:- using System; namespace StructClassTest { struct A { public string Foobar { get; set; } } class B { public string Foobar { get; set; } } class Program { static void Main() { A a = new A(); a.Foobar = \"hi\"; B b = new B(); b.Foobar = \"hi\"; StructTest(a); ClassTest(b); Console.WriteLine(\"a.Foobar={0}, b.Foobar={1}\", a.Foobar, b.Foobar); Console.ReadKey(true); } static void StructTest(A a) { a.Foobar = \"hello\"; } static void ClassTest(B b) { b.Foobar = \"hello\"; } } } The struct will be passed by value so StructTest() will get it's own A struct and when it changes a.Foobar will change the Foobar of its new type. ClassTest() will receive a reference to b and thus the .Foobar property of b will be changed. Thus we'd obtain the following output:- a.Foobar=hi, b.Foobar=hello So if you desire value type semantics then that would be another reason to declare something as a struct.

The phone in question runs the Nokia Series 60 UI (these days called s60). Symbian phones have traditionally been split into the OS bit (Symbian OS v9.1, 9.2 etc) and the phone vendor buys or develops their own UI. A particular version of s60 will run on a specific version of Symbian OS. So a good place to start for development on your phone is Forum Nokia: http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/resources/technologies/symbian/documentation/getting_started.html This will cover the UI bits and pieces. I should add that UI vendors do perform a lot of OS customisation themselves (with varying degrees of self-control/quality) so differences in API's especially involving hardware can become esoteric. Symbian itself does provide a decent level of quality of documentation, not up there with Microsoft but better than a lot of open source offerring.

Carbide has on-device debugging and includes the compilers for PC and ARM (GCC-E) targets.

Unfortunately, they can be a bit wordy to set up, and you sometimes have to pass them the same info twice. I've used MDB2 in a couple of projects, and I tended to write a thin veneer around it, especially for specifying the types of fields. I generally make an object that knows about a particular table and its columns, and then a helper function in that fills in field types for me when I call an MDB2 query function. For instance: function MakeTableTypes($TableName, $FieldNames) { $Types = array(); foreach ($FieldNames as $FieldName = $FieldValue) { $Types[] = $this- Tables[$TableName]['schema'][$FieldName]['type']; } return $Types; } Obviously this object has a map of table names -> schemas that it knows about, and just extracts the types of the fields you specify, and returns an matching type array suitable for use with an MDB2 query. MDB2 (and similar libraries) then handle the parameter substitution for you, so for update/insert queries, you just build a hash/map from column name to value, and use the 'autoExecute' functions to build and execute the relevant query. For example: function UpdateArticle($Article) { $Types = $this- MakeTableTypes($table_name, $Article); $res = $this- MDB2- extended- autoExecute($table_name, $Article, MDB2_AUTOQUERY_UPDATE, 'id = '.$this- MDB2- quote($Article['id'], 'integer'), $Types); } and MDB2 will build the query, escaping everything properly, etc. I'd recommend measuring performance with MDB2 though, as it pulls in a fair bit of code that might cause you problems if you're not running a PHP accelerator. As I say, the setup overhead seems daunting at first, but once it's done the queries can be simpler/more symbolic to write and (especially) modify. I think MDB2 should know a bit more about your schema, which would simpify some of the commonly used API calls, but you can reduce the annoyance of this by encapsulating the schema yourself, as I mentioned above, and providing simple accessor functions that generate the arrays MDB2 needs to perform these queries. Of course you can just do flat SQL queries as a string using the query() function if you want, so you're not forced to switch over to the full 'MDB2 way' - you can try it out piecemeal, and see if you hate it or not.

There are a few tricks to avoid race conditions involving using O_EXCL (exclusing locking) to open the file and symbolic links.
