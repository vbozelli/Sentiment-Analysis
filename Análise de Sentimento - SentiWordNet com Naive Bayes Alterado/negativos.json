Only the later applies to .Net for perfectly managed objects. However, not all classes are perfect and at some point an underlying unmanaged implementation could leak resources permanently for that process. In all cases, the application consumes more memory than strictly needed. The sides effects, depending on the ammount leaked, could go from none, to slowdown caused by excessive collection, to a series of memory exceptions and finally a fatal error followed by forced process termination. You know an application has a memory problem when monitoring shows that more and more memory is allocated to your process after each garbage collection cycle. In such case, you are either keeping too much in memory, or some underlying unmanaged implementation is leaking. For most leaks, resources are recovered when the process is terminated, however some resources are not always recovered in some precise cases, GDI cursor handles are notorious for that. Of course, if you have an interprocess communication mechanism, memory allocated in the other process would not be freed until that process frees it or terminates.","pontos":22},{"corpo":"I would define memory leaks as an object not freeing up all the memory allocated after it has completed.

I have also found not tiding up after using certain objects like pens can cause the issue. I personally have suffered Out of Memory Exceptions which can be caused but are not exclusive to memory leaks in dot net applications. (OOM can also come from pinning see Pinning Artical). If you are not getting OOM errors or need to confirm if it is a memory leak causing it then the only way is to profile your application. I would also try and ensure the following: a) Everything that implements Idisposable is disposed either using a finally block or the using statement these include brushes, pens etc.(some people argue to set everything to nothing in addition) b)Anything that has a close method is closed again using finally or the using statement (although I have found using does not always close depending if you declared the object outside the using statement) c)If you are using unmanaged code/windows API's that these are dealt with correctly after.

But is also not worse. It's different. The key difference is that it is decentralized. Imagine you are a developer on the road, you develop on your laptop and you want to have source control so that you can go back 3 hours. With Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach (in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it. With Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it. This looks good at first, but just keep in mind the added complexity to this approach. Git seems to be the \"new, shiny, cool\" thing. It's by no means bad (there is a reason Linus wrote it for the Linux Kernel development after all), but I feel that many people jump on the \"Distributed Source Control\" train just because it's new and is written by Linus Torvalds, without actually knowing why/if it's better. Subversion has Problems, but so does Git, Mercurial, CVS, TFS or whatever. Edit: So this answer is now a year old and still generates many upvotes, so I thought I'll add some more explanations. In the last year since writing this, Git has gained a lot of momentum and support, particularly since sites like GitHub really took off. I'm using both Git and Subversion nowadays and I'd like to share some personal insight. First of all, Git can be really confusing at first when working decentralized. What is a remote? and How to properly set up the initial repository? are two questions that come up at the beginning, especially compared to SVN's simple \"svnadmin create\", Git's \"git init\" can take the parameters --bare and --shared which seems to be the \"proper\" way to set up a centralized repository. There are reasons for this, but it adds complexity. The documentation of the \"checkout\" command is very confusing to people changing over - the \"proper\" way seems to be \"git clone\", while \"git checkout\" seems to switch branches. Git REALLY shines when you are decentralized. I have a server at home and a Laptop on the road, and SVN simply doesn't work well here. With SVN, I can't have local source control if I'm not connected to the repository (Yes, I know about SVK or about ways to copy the repo). With Git, that's the default mode anyway. It's an extra command though (git commit commits locally, whereas git push origin master pushes the master branch to the remote named \"origin\"). As said above: Git adds complexity. Two modes of creating repositories, checkout vs. clone, commit vs. push... You have to know which commands work locally and which work with \"the server\" (I'm assuming most people still like a central \"master-repository\"). Also, the tooling is still insufficient, at least on Windows. Yes, there is a Visual Studio AddIn, but I still use git bash with msysgit. SVN has the advantage that it's MUCH simpler to learn: There is your repository, all changes to towards it, if you know how to create, commit and checkout and you're ready to go and can pickup stuff like branching, update etc. later on. Git has the advantage that it's MUCH better suited if some developers are not always connected to the master repository. Also, it's much faster than SVN. And from what I hear, branching and merging support is a lot better (which is to be expected, as these are the core reasons it was written). This also explains why it gains so much buzz on the Internet, as Git is perfectly suited for Open Source projects: Just Fork it, commit your changes to your own Fork, and then ask the original project maintainer to pull your changes. With Git, this just works. Really, try it on Github, it's magic. What I also see are Git-SVN Bridges: The central repository is a Subversion repo, but developers locally work with Git and the bridge then pushes their changes to SVN. But even with this lengthy addition, I still stand by my core message: Git is not better or worse, it's just different. If you have the need for \"Offline Source Control\" and the willingness to spend some extra time learning it, it's fantastic. But if you have a strictly centralized Source Control and/or are struggling to introduce Source Control in the first place because your co-workers are not interested, then the simplicity and excellent tooling (at least on Windows) of SVN shine.

If you need a change from someone else, though, she has to commit to her local repo and then she must push that changeset to you or you must pull it from her. My own reasoning also makes me think DVCS makes things harder for QA and release management if you do things like centralized releases. Someone has to be responsible for doing that push/pull from everyone else's repository, resolving any conflicts that would have been resolved at initial commit time before, then doing the build, and then having all the other developers re-sync their repos. All of this can be addressed with human processes, of course; DVCS just broke something that was fixed by centralized version control in order to provide some new conveniences.","pontos":5},{"corpo":"@Karl In PHP5 variables are by default passed by value and objects are by default passed by reference.

If it were just 2 people, I'd say git is also easier, because you can just push and pull from eachother. Once you get beyond that though, I'd go for subversion, because at that point you need to set up a 'dedicated' server or location. You can do this just as well with git as with SVN, but the benefits of git get outweighed by the need to do additional steps to synch with a central server. In SVN you just commit. In git you have to git commit, then git push. The additional step gets annoying simply because you end up doing it so much.

If you get lazy and don't notify the people in charge of translations, or you embed strings without going through your localization system, it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later. Similarly, if localization is an afterthought, it will be very difficult to put in place. Bottom line, if you don't have all visible strings stored externally in a standard place, it will be very difficult to find all that need to be localized. One other note, very strictly avoid concatenating visible strings directly, such as String message = \"The \" + item + \" is on sale!\"; Instead, you must use something like String message = String.Format(\"The {0} is on sale!\", item); The reason for this is that different languages often order the words differently, and concatenating strings directly will need a new build to fix, but if you used some kind of string replacement mechanism like above, you can modify your .resx file (or whatever localization files you use) for the specific language that needs to reorder the words.

When data is stored on disk based storage devices, it is stored as blocks of data. These blocks are accessed in their entirety, making them the atomic disk access operation. Disk blocks are structured in much the same way as linked lists; both contain a section for data, a pointer to the location of the next node (or block), and both need not be stored contiguously. Due to the fact that a number of records can only be sorted on one field, we can state that searching on a field that isn’t sorted requires a Linear Search which requires block accesses (on average), where is the number of blocks that the table spans. If that field is a non-key field (i.e. doesn’t contain unique entries) then the entire table space must be searched at block accesses. Whereas with a sorted field, a Binary Search may be used, this has block accesses. Also since the data is sorted given a non-key field, the rest of the table doesn’t need to be searched for duplicate values, once a higher value is found. Thus the performance increase is substantial. What is indexing? Indexing is a way of sorting a number of records on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure which holds the field value, and pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure is then sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be performed on it. The downside to indexing is that these indexes require additional space on the disk, since the indexes are stored together in a table using the MyISAM engine, this file can quickly reach the size limits of the underlying file system if many fields within the same table are indexed. How does it work? Firstly, let’s outline a sample database table schema; Field name Data type Size on disk id (Primary key) Unsigned INT 4 bytes firstName Char(50) 50 bytes lastName Char(50) 50 bytes emailAddress Char(100) 100 bytes Note: char was used in place of varchar to allow for an accurate size on disk value. This sample database contains five million rows, and is unindexed. The performance of several queries will now be analyzed. These are a query using the id (a sorted key field) and one using the firstName (a non-key unsorted field). Example 1 Given our sample database of records of a fixed size giving a record length of bytes and they are stored in a table using the MyISAM engine which is using the default block size bytes. The blocking factor of the table would be records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the table is blocks. A linear search on the id field would require an average of block accesses to find a value given that the id field is a key field. But since the id field is also sorted a binary search can be conducted requiring an average of block accesses. Instantly we can see this is a drastic improvement. Now the firstName field is neither sorted, so a binary search is impossible, nor are the values unique, and thus the table will require searching to the end for an exact block accesses. It is this situation that indexing aims to correct. Given that an index record contains only the indexed field and a pointer to the original record, it stands to reason that it will be smaller than the multi-field record that it points to. So the index itself requires fewer disk blocks that the original table, which therefore requires fewer block accesses to iterate through. The schema for an index on the firstName field is outlined below; Field name Data type Size on disk firstName Char(50) 50 bytes (record pointer) Special 4 bytes Note: Pointers in MySQL are 2, 3, 4 or 5 bytes in length depending on the size of the table. Example 2 Given our sample database of records with an index record length of bytes and using the default block size bytes. The blocking factor of the index would be records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the table is blocks. Now a search using the firstName field can utilise the index to increase performance. This allows for a binary search of the index with an average of block accesses. To find the address of the actual record, which requires a further block access to read, bringing the total to block accesses, a far cry from the 277,778 block accesses required by the non-indexed table. When should it be used? Given that creating an index requires additional disk space (277,778 blocks extra from the above example), and that too many indexes can cause issues arising from the file systems size limits, careful thought must be used to select the correct fields to index. Since indexes are only used to speed up the searching for a matching field within the records, it stands to reason that indexing fields used only for output would be simply a waste of disk space and processing time when doing an insert or delete operation, and thus should be avoided. Also given the nature of a binary search, the cardinality or uniqueness of the data is important. Indexing on a field with a cardinality of 2 would split the data in half, whereas a cardinality of 1,000 would return approximately 1,000 records. With such a low cardinality the effectiveness is reduced to a linear sort, and the query optimizer will avoid using the index if the cardinality is less than 30% of the record number, effectively making the index a waste of space.

If your pointer points to the first x, and . means free memory location, and you grow the memory size pointed to by your variable by 5 bytes, it'll succeed. This is of course a simplified example as blocks are rounded up to a certain size for alignment, but anyway. However, if you subsequently try to grow it by another 10 bytes, and there is only 5 available, it will need to move the block in memory and update your pointer. However, in your example you are passing the function a pointer to the character, not a pointer to your variable, and thus while the strrep function internally might be able to adjust the variable in use, it is a local variable to the strrep function and your calling code will be left with the original pointer variable value.

The downside with using signed numbers is that there's a temptation to overload them so that, for example, the values 0- n are the menu selection, and -1 means nothing's selected - rather than creating a class that has two variables, one to indicate if something is selected and another to store what that selection is.

Correct: int is an alias for System.Int32. Wrong: float is not an alias for System.Float, but for System.Single Basically, int is a reserved keyword in the C# programming language, and is an alias for the System.Int32 value type. float and Float is not the same however, as the right system type for ''float'' is System.Single. There are some types like this that has reserved keywords that doesn't seem to match the type names directly. In C# there is no difference between ''int'' and ''System.Int32'', or any of the other pairs or keywords/system types, except for when defining enums. With enums you can specify the storage size to use and in this case you can only use the reserved keyword, and not the system runtime type name. Wether the value in the int will be stored on the stack, in memory, or as a referenced heap object depends on the context and how you use it. This declaration in a method: defines a variable i of type System.Int32, living in a register or on the stack, depending on optimizations. The same declaration in a type (struct or class) defines a member field. The same declaration in a method argument list defines a parameter, with the same storage options as for a local variable. (note that this paragraph is not valid if you start pulling iterator methods into the mix, these are different beasts altogether) To get a heap object, you can use boxing: this will create a boxed copy of the contents of i on the heap. In IL you can access methods on the heap object directly, but in C# you need to cast it back to an int, which will create another copy. Thus, the object on the heap cannot easily be changed in C# without creating a new boxed copy of a new int value.

Character Sets Unicode is great, but you can't get away with ignoring other character sets. The default character set on Windows XP (English) is Cp1252. On the web, you don't know what a browser will send you (though hopefully your container will handle most of this). And don't be surprised when there are bugs in whatever implementation you are using. Character sets can have interesting interactions with filenames when they move to between machines. Translating Strings Translators are, generally speaking, not coders. If you send a source file to a translator, they will break it. Strings should be extracted to resource files (e.g. properties files in Java or resource DLLs in Visual C++). Translators should be given files that are difficult to break and tools that don't let them break them. Translators do not know where strings come from in a product. It is difficult to translate a string without context. If you do not provide guidance, the quality of the translation will suffer. While on the subject of context, you may see the same string \"foo\" crop up in multiple times and think it would be more efficient to have all instances in the UI point to the same resource. This is a bad idea. Words may be very context-sensitive in some languages. Translating strings costs money. If you release a new version of a product, it makes sense to recover the old versions. Have tools to recover strings from your old resource files. String concatenation and manual manipulation of strings should be minimized. Use the format functions where applicable. Translators need to be able to modify hotkeys. Ctrl+P is print in English; the Germans use Ctrl+D. If you have a translation process that requires someone to manually cut and paste strings at any time, you are asking for trouble. Dates, Times, Calendars, Currency, Number Formats, Time Zones These can all vary from country to country. A comma may be used to denote decimal places. Times may be in 24hour notation. Not everyone uses the Gregorian calendar. You need to be unambiguous, too. If you take care to display dates as MM/DD/YYYY for the USA and DD/MM/YYYY for the UK on your website, the dates are ambiguous unless the user knows you've done it. Especially Currency The Locale functions provided in the class libraries will give you the local currency symbol, but you can't just stick a pound (sterling) or euro symbol in front of a value that gives a price in dollars. User Interfaces Layout should be dynamic. Not only are strings likely to double in length on translation, the entire UI may need to be inverted (Hebrew; Arabic) so that the controls run from right to left. And that is before we get to Asia. Testing Prior To Translation Use static analysis of your code to locate problems. At a bare minimum, leverage the tools built into your IDE. (Eclipse users can go to Window > Preferences > Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings and check for non-externalised strings.) Smoke test by simulating translation. It isn't difficult to parse a resource file and replace strings with a pseudo-translated version that doubles the length and inserts funky characters. You don't have to speak a language to use a foreign operating system. Modern systems should let you log in as a foreign user with translated strings and foreign locale. If you are familiar with your OS, you can figure out what does what without knowing a single word of the language. Keyboard maps and character set references are very useful. Virtualisation would be very useful here. Non-technical Issues Sometimes you have to be sensitive to cultural differences (offence or incomprehension may result). A mistake you often see is the use of flags as a visual cue choosing a website language or geography. Unless you want your software to declare sides in global politics, this is a bad idea. If you were French and offered the option for English with St. George's flag (the flag of England is a red cross on a white field), this might result in confusion for many English speakers - assume similar issues will arise with foreign languages and countries. Icons need to be vetted for cultural relevance. What does a thumbs-up or a green tick mean?

(for example a language like c++ allows the developer to pass a parameter by reference using ' ' after the parameter's type) now the tricky part, or at least the part that will confuse most of the new java developers: (borrowed from javaworld) Original author: Tony Sintes tricky successfully changes the value of pnt1! This would imply that Objects are passed by reference, this is not the case! A correct statement would be: the Object references are passed by value. more from Tony Sintes: The method successfully alters the value of pnt1, even though it is passed by value; however, a swap of pnt1 and pnt2 fails! This is the major source of confusion. In the main() method, pnt1 and pnt2 are nothing more than object references. When you pass pnt1 and pnt2 to the tricky() method, Java passes the references by value just like any other parameter. This means the references passed to the method are actually copies of the original references. Figure 1 below shows two references pointing to the same object after Java passes an object to a method. Conclusion or a long story short: Java passes it parameters by value \"by value\" is the only way in java to pass a parameter to a method using methods from the object given as parameter will alter the object as the references point to the original objects. (if that method itself alters some values) useful links: http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2000-05/03-qa-0526-pass.html http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-passbyval/ http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-praxis/pr1.html http://javadude.com/articles/passbyvalue.htm ","pontos":30},{"corpo":"In PHP, best practice is to use MySQLi (Tutorial) or PDO bound parameters in prepared statements. addslashes() is no longer recommended as it is is too easy to defeat.

To such people, the iterative approach (typically using loops) feels more natural. Those of us who cut our programming teeth on procedural or object-oriented programming have often been told to avoid recursion because it's error prone. We're often told that recursion is slow. Calling and returning from a routine repeatedly involves a lot of stack pushing and popping, which is slower than looping. I think some languages handle this better than others, and those languages are most likely not those where the dominant paradigm is procedural or object-oriented.

To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure. Instead of your program explicitly controlling everything, your program sets up a class or library with certain functions to be called when certain things happen. It solves code duplication. For example, in the old days you would manually write your own event loop, polling the system libraries for new events. Nowadays, most modern APIs you simply tell the system libraries what events you're interested in, and it will let you know when they happen. Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control. Inversion of control is made easy in many languages through the concept of delegates, interfaces, or even raw function pointers. It is not appropriate to use in all cases, because the flow of a program can be harder to follow when written this way. It's a useful way to design methods when writing a library that will be reused, but it should be used sparingly in the core of your own program unless it really solves a code duplication problem.

To see why, walk through the steps that the above languages use to call a function: space is carved out on the stack for the function's arguments and local variables the function's arguments are copied into this new space control jumps to the function the function's code runs the function's result is copied into a return value the stack is rewound to its previous position control jumps back to where the function was called Doing all of these steps takes time, usually a little bit more than it takes to iterate through a loop. However, the real problem is in step #1. When many programs start, they allocate a single chunk of memory for their stack, and when they run out of that memory (often, but not always due to recursion), the program crashes due to a stack overflow. So in these languages recursion is slower and it makes you vulnerable to crashing. There are still some arguments for using it though. In general, code written recursively is shorter and a bit more elegant, once you know how to read it. There is a technique that language implementers can use called tail call optimization which can eliminate some classes of stack overflow. Put succinctly: if a function's return expression is simply the result of a function call, then you don't need to add a new level onto the stack, you can reuse the current one for the function being called. Regrettably, few imperative language-implementations have tail-call optimization built in. * I love recursion. My favorite static language doesn't use loops at all, recursion is the only way to do something repeatedly. I just don't think that recursion is generally a good idea in languages that aren't tuned for it. ** By the way Mario, the typical name for your ArrangeString function is \"join\", and I'd be surprised if your language of choice doesn't already have an implementation of it.

My favorite is that it allows you to use validation as a form of regression testing, preventing the markup equivalent of \"delta rot\" from leading to real rendering problems once the errors reach some critical mass. And really, it's just plain sloppy to allow \"lazy\" errors like typos and mis-nested/unclosed tags to accumulate. Valid markup is one way to identify passionate programmers. There's also the issue of debugging: valid markup also gives you a stable baseline from which to work on the inevitable cross-browser compatibility woes. No web developer who values his time should begin debugging browser compatibility problems without first ensuring that the markup is at least syntactically valid—and any other invalid markup should have a good reason for being there. (Incidentally, stackoverflow.com fails both these tests, and suggestions to fix the problems were declined.) All of that said, to answer your specific question, it's probably not worthwhile to use one of the XHTML doctypes unless you plan to produce valid (or at least well-formed) markup. XHTML's primary advantages are derived from the fact that XHTML is XML, allowing it to be processed and transformed by tools and technologies that work with XML. If you don't plan to make your XHTML well-formed XML, then there's little point in choosing that doctype. The latest HTML 4 spec will probably do everything you need, and it's much more forgiving.","pontos":16},{"corpo":"I don't have a solution, but I'm betting that relying on the referrer will never work because user-agents are free to not send it at all or spoof it to something that will let them in.

Conclusion: If you know, or is willing to accept, that the end loop index is constant for the duration of the loop, place it into a variable. Edit: Re-read your post, and yes, you might see negligible performance gains for your two cases as well, because the JITter optimizes the code.

I'd say that if the color of the home page was originally designed to be red, and for some reason it is blue, that's easily a quick fix and doesn't need to involve many people or man-hours to do the change. Just check out the file, change the color, check it back in and update the bug. However, if the color of the home page was designed to be red, and is red, but someone thinks it needs to be blue, that is, to me anyway, a different type of change. For instance, have someone thought about the impact this might have on other parts of the page, like images and logos overlaying the blue background? Could there be borders of things that looks bad? Link underlining is blue, will that show up? As an example, I am red/green color blind, changing the color of something is, for me, not something I take lightly. There are enough webpages on the web that gives me problems. Just to make a point that even the most trivial change can be nontrivial if you consider everything. The actual end implementation change is probably much of the same, but to me a change request is a different beast, precisely because it needs to be thought about more to make sure it will work as expected. A bug, however, is that someone said this is how we're going to do it and then someone did it differently. A change request is more like but we need to consider this other thing as well... hmm.... There are exceptions of course, but let me take your examples apart. If the server was designed to handle more than 300,000,000,000 pageviews, then yes, it is a bug that it doesn't. But designing a server to handle that many pageviews is more than just saying our server should handle 300,000,000,000 pageviews, it should contain a very detailed specification for how it can do that, right down to processing time guarantees and disk access average times. If the code is then implemented exactly as designed, and unable to perform as expected, then the question becomes: did we design it incorrectly or did we implement it incorrectly?. I agree that in this case, wether it is to be considered a design flaw or a implementation flaw depends on the actual reason for why it fails to live up to expectations. For instance, if someone assumed disks were 100x times as fast as they actually are, and this is deemed to be the reason for why the server fails to perform as expected, I'd say this is a design bug, and someone needs to redesign. If the original requirement of that many pageviews is still to be held, a major redesign with more in-memory data and similar might have to be undertaken. However, if someone has just failed to take into account how raid disks operate and how to correctly benefit from striped media, that's a bug and might not need that big of a change to fix.

If you want to use the original definition of it, it might make more sense, but other than that it is mostly syntactic sugar. If you read the Wikipedia article on the subject, you'll find two conflicting notations, Systems Hungarian Notation and Apps Hungarian Notation. The original, good, definition is the Apps Hungarian Notation, but most people use the Systems Hungarian Notation. As an example of the two, consider prefixing variables with l for length, a for area and v for volume. With such notation, the following expression makes sense: int vBox = aBottom * lVerticalSide; but this doesn't: int aBottom = lSide1; If you're mixing the prefixes, they're to be considered part of the equation, and volume = area * length is fine for a box, but copying a length value into an area variable should raise some red flags. Unfortunately, the other notation is less useful, where people prefix the variable names with the type of the value, like this: int iLength; int iVolume; int iArea; some people use n for number, or i for integer, f for float, s for string etc. The original prefix was meant to be used to spot problems in equations, but has somehow devolved into making the code slightly easier to read since you don't have to go look for the variable declaration. With todays smart editors where you can simply hover over any variable to find the full type, and not just an abbreviation for it, this type of hungarian notation has lost a lot of its meaning. But, you should make up your own mind. All I can say is that I don't use either. Edit Just to add a short notice, while I don't use Hungarian Notation, I do use a prefix, and it's the underscore.

Read Joel Spolsky's article Making Wrong Code Look Wrong for appropriate perspective and justification. Essentially, type based Hungarian notation, where variables are prefixed with information about their type (e.g. whether an object is a string, a handle, an int, etc.) is mostly useless and generally just adds overhead with very little benefit. This, sadly, is the Hungarian notation most people are familiar with. However, the intent of Hungarian notation as envisioned is to add information on the \"kind\" of data the variable contains. This allows you to partition kinds of data from other kinds of data which shouldn't be allowed to be mixed together except, possibly, through some conversion process. For example, pixel based coordinates vs. coordinates in other units, or unsafe user input versus data from safe sources, etc. Look at it this way, if you find yourself spelunking through code to find out information on a variable then you probably need to adjust your naming scheme to contain that information, this is the essence of the Hungarian convention. Note that an alternative to Hungarian notation is to use more classes to show the intent of variable usage rather than relying on primitive types everywhere. For example, instead of having variable prefixes for unsafe user input, you can have simple string wrapper class for unsafe user input, and a separate wrapper class for safe data. This has the advantage, in strongly typed languages, of having partitioning enforced by the compiler (even in less strongly typed languages you can usually add your own tripwire code) but adds a not insignificant amount of overhead.","pontos":17},{"corpo":"Ok, I finally figured it out.

Are there any tools or thought processes that helped you understand how pointers work at the variable, function, and beyond level? Addresses boxes. I remember when I was learning to program BASIC into microcomputers, there were these pretty books with games in them, and sometimes you had to poke values into particular addresses. They had a picture of a bunch of boxes, incrementally labelled with 0, 1, 2... and it was explained that only one small thing (a byte) could fit in these boxes, and there were a lot of them - some computers had as many as 65535!

","pontos":2},{"corpo":"Pointers is a concept that for many can be confusing at first, in particular when it comes to copying pointer values around and still referencing the same memory block. I've found that the best analogy is to consider the pointer as a piece of paper with a house address on it, and the memory block it references as the actual house. All sorts of operations can thus be easily explained. I've added some Delphi code down below, and some comments where appropriate. I chose Delphi since my other main programming language, C#, does not exhibit things like memory leaks in the same way. If you only wish to learn the high-level concept of pointers, then you should ignore the parts labelled \"Memory layout\" in the explanation below. They are intended to give examples of what memory could look like after operations, but they are more low-level in nature. However, in order to accurately explain how buffer overruns really work, it was important that I added these diagrams. Disclaimer: For all intents and purposes, this explanation and the example memory layouts are vastly simplified. There's more overhead and a lot more details you would need to know if you need to deal with memory on a low-level basis. However, for the intents of explaining memory and pointers, it is accurate enough. Let's assume the THouse class used below looks like this: type THouse = class private FName : array[0..9] of Char; public constructor Create(name: PChar); end; When you initialize the house object, the name given to the constructor is copied into the private field FName. There is a reason it is defined as a fixed-size array. In memory, there will be some overhead associated with the house allocation, I'll illustrate this below like this: ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- ^ ^ | | | +- the FName array | +- overhead The \"tttt\" area is overhead, there will typically be more of this for various types of runtimes and languages, like 8 or 12 bytes. It is imperative that whatever values are stored in this area never gets changed by anything other than the memory allocator or the core system routines, or you risk crashing the program. Allocate memory Get an entrepreneur to build your house, and give you the address to the house. In contrast to the real world, memory allocation cannot be told where to allocate, but will find a suitable spot with enough room, and report back the address to the allocated memory. In other words, the entrepreneur will choose the spot. THouse.Create('My house'); Memory layout: ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- 1234My house Keep a variable with the address Write the address to your new house down on a piece of paper. This paper will serve as your reference to your house. Without this piece of paper, you're lost, and cannot find the house, unless you're already in it. var h: THouse; begin h := THouse.Create('My house'); ... Memory layout: h v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- 1234My house Copy pointer value Just write the address on a new piece of paper. You now have two pieces of paper that will get you to the same house, not two separate houses. Any attempts to follow the address from one paper and rearrange the furniture at that house will make it seem that the other house has been modified in the same manner, unless you can explicitly detect that it's actually just one house. Note This is usually the concept that I have the most problem explaining to people, two pointers does not mean two objects or memory blocks. var h1, h2: THouse; begin h1 := THouse.Create('My house'); h2 := h1; // copies the address, not the house ... h1 v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- 1234My house ^ h2 Freeing the memory Demolish the house. You can then later on reuse the paper for a new address if you so wish, or clear it to forget the address to the house that no longer exists. var h: THouse; begin h := THouse.Create('My house'); ... h.Free; h := nil; Here I first construct the house, and get hold of its address. Then I do something to the house (use it, the ... code, left as an exercise for the reader), and then I free it. Lastly I clear the address from my variable. Memory layout: h --+ v +- before free ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- | 1234My house --+ h (now points nowhere) --+ +- after free ---------------------- | (note, memory might still xx34My house --+ contain some data) Dangling pointers You tell your entrepreneur to destroy the house, but you forget to erase the address from your piece of paper. When later on you look at the piece of paper, you've forgotten that the house is no longer there, and goes to visit it, with failed results (see also the part about an invalid reference below). var h: THouse; begin h := THouse.Create('My house'); ... h.Free; ... // forgot to clear h here h.OpenFrontDoor; // will most likely fail Using after the call to might work, but that is just pure luck. Most likely it will fail, at a customers place, in the middle of a critical operation. h --+ v +- before free ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- | 1234My house --+ h --+ v +- after free ---------------------- | xx34My house --+ As you can see, h still points to the remnants of the data in memory, but since it might not be complete, using it as before might fail. Memory leak You lose the piece of paper and cannot find the house. The house is still standing somewhere though, and when you later on want to construct a new house, you cannot reuse that spot. var h: THouse; begin h := THouse.Create('My house'); h := THouse.Create('My house'); // uh-oh, what happened to our first house? ... h.Free; h := nil; Here we overwrote the contents of the variable with the address of a new house, but the old one is still standing... somewhere. After this code, there is no way to reach that house, and it will be left standing. In other words, the allocated memory will stay allocated until the application closes, at which point the operating system will tear it down. Memory layout after first allocation: h v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- 1234My house Memory layout after second allocation: h v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN] 1234My house 5678My house A more common way to get this method is just to forget to free something, instead of overwriting it as above. In Delphi terms, this will occur with the following method: procedure OpenTheFrontDoorOfANewHouse; var h: THouse; begin h := THouse.Create('My house'); h.OpenFrontDoor; // uh-oh, no .Free here, where does the address go? end; After this method has executed, there's no place in our variables that the address to the house exists, but the house is still out there. Memory layout: h --+ v +- before losing pointer ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- | 1234My house --+ h (now points nowhere) --+ +- after losing pointer ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- | 1234My house --+ As you can see, the old data is left intact in memory, and will not be reused by the memory allocator. The allocator keeps track of which areas of memory has been used, and will not reuse them unless you free it. Freeing the memory but keeping a (now invalid) reference Demolish the house, erase one of the pieces of paper but you also have another piece of paper with the old address on it, when you go to the address, you won't find a house, but you might find something that resembles the ruins of one. Perhaps you will even find a house, but it is not the house you were originally given the address to, and thus any attempts to use it as though it belongs to you might fail horribly. Sometimes you might even find that a neighbouring address has a rather big house set up on it that occupies three address (Main Street 1-3), and your address goes to the middle of the house. Any attempts to treat that part of the large 3-address house as a single small house might also fail horribly. var h1, h2: THouse; begin h1 := THouse.Create('My house'); h2 := h1; // copies the address, not the house ... h1.Free; h1 := nil; h2.OpenFrontDoor; // uh-oh, what happened to our house? Here the house was torn down, through the reference in , and while was cleared as well, still has the old, out-of-date, address. Access to the house that is no longer standing might or might not work. This is a variation of the dangling pointer above. See its memory layout. Buffer overrun You move more stuff into the house than you can possibly fit, spilling into the neighbours house or yard. When the owner of that neighbouring house later on comes home, he'll find all sorts of things he'll consider his own. This is the reason I chose a fixed-size array. To set the stage, assume that the second house we allocate will, for some reason, be placed before the first one in memory. In other words, the second house will have a lower address than the first one. Also, they're allocated right next to each other. Thus, this code: var h1, h2: THouse; begin h1 := THouse.Create('My house'); h2 := THouse.Create('My other house somewhere'); ^-----------------------^ longer than 10 characters 0123456789 -- 10 characters Memory layout after first allocation: h1 v -----------------------[ttttNNNNNNNNNN] 5678My house Memory layout after second allocation: h2 h1 v v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]----[ttttNNNNNNNNNN] 1234My other house somewhereouse ^---+--^ | +- overwritten The part that will most often cause crash is when you overwrite important parts of the data you stored that really should not be randomly changed. For instance it might not be a problem that parts of the name of the h1-house was changed, in terms of crashing the program, but overwriting the overhead of the object will most likely crash when you try to use the broken object, as will overwriting links that is stored to other objects in the object. Linked lists When you follow an address on a piece of paper, you get to a house, and at that house there is another piece of paper with a new address on it, for the next house in the chain, and so on. var h1, h2: THouse; begin h1 := THouse.Create('Home'); h2 := THouse.Create('Cabin'); h1.NextHouse := h2; Here we create a link from our home house to our cabin. We can follow the chain until a house has no reference, which means it's the last one. To visit all our houses, we could use the following code: var h1, h2: THouse; h: THouse; begin h1 := THouse.Create('Home'); h2 := THouse.Create('Cabin'); h1.NextHouse := h2; ... h := h1; while h nil do begin h.LockAllDoors; h.CloseAllWindows; h := h.NextHouse; end; Memory layout (added NextHouse as a link in the object, noted with the four LLLL's in the below diagram): h1 h2 v v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL]----[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL] 1234Home + 5678Cabin + | ^ | +--------+ * (no link) In basic terms, what is a memory address? A memory address is in basic terms just a number. If you think of memory as a big array of bytes, the very first byte has the address 0, the next one the address 1 and so on upwards. This is simplified, but good enough. So this memory layout: h1 h2 v v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN] 1234My house 5678My house Might have these two address (the leftmost - is address 0): h1 = 4 h2 = 23 Which means that our linked list above might actuall look like this: h1 (=4) h2 (=28) v v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL]----[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL] 1234Home 0028 5678Cabin 0000 | ^ | +--------+ * (no link) It is typical to store an address that \"points nowhere\" as a zero-address. In basic terms, what is a pointer? A pointer is just a variable holding a memory address. You can typically ask the programming language to give you its number, but most programming languages and runtimes tries to hide the fact that there is a number beneath, just because the number itself does not really hold any meaning to you. It is best to think of a pointer as a black box, ie. you don't really know or care about how it is actually implemented, just as long as it works.

(Wayback Machine) To quote: The simple limits you will probably see with memcache are the key and item size limits. Keys are restricted to 250 characters. Stored data cannot exceed 1 megabyte in size, since that is the largest typical slab size.\" The FAQ has now been revised and there are now two separate questions covering this: What is the maxiumum key length? (250 bytes) The maximum size of a key is 250 characters. Note this value will be less if you are using client \"prefixes\" or similar features, since the prefix is tacked onto the front of the original key. Shorter keys are generally better since they save memory and use less bandwidth. Why are items limited to 1 megabyte in size? Ahh, this is a popular question! Short answer: Because of how the memory allocator's algorithm works. Long answer: Memcached's memory storage engine (which will be pluggable/adjusted in the future...), uses a slabs approach to memory management. Memory is broken up into slabs chunks of varying sizes, starting at a minimum number and ascending by a factorial up to the largest possible value. Say the minimum value is 400 bytes, and the maximum value is 1 megabyte, and the factorial is 1.20: slab 1 - 400 bytes slab 2 - 480 bytes slab 3 - 576 bytes ... etc. The larger the slab, the more of a gap there is between it and the previous slab. So the larger the maximum value the less efficient the memory storage is. Memcached also has to pre-allocate some memory for every slab that exists, so setting a smaller factorial with a larger max value will require even more overhead. There're other reason why you wouldn't want to do that... If we're talking about a web page and you're attempting to store/load values that large, you're probably doing something wrong. At that size it'll take a noticeable amount of time to load and unpack the data structure into memory, and your site will likely not perform very well.

You could use it to check your various myRand() programs. As for your last program, if you generate 10000 values, why don't you choose the final value amongst the 10 thousand? You restrict yourself to a subset. Also, it won't work if your $min and $max are greater than 10000. Anyway, the randomness you need depends on your application. rand() will be OK for an online game, but not OK for cryptography (anything not thoroughly tested with statistical programs will not be suitable for cryptography anyway).

This is my first stackoverflow answer. :) As has been pointed out, when realloc() is called, you can potentially change the pointer to the memory being reallocated. When this happens, the argument \"string\" becomes invalid. Even if you reassign it, the change goes out of scope once the function ends. To answer the OP, realloc() returns a pointer to the newly-reallocated memory. The return value needs to be stored somewhere. Generally, you would do this: As TyBoer points out, you guys can't change the value of the pointer being passed in as the input to this function. You can assign whatever you want, but the change will go out of scope at the end of the function. In the following block, \"input\" may or may not be an invalid pointer once the function completes: Mark tries to work around this by returning the new pointer as the output of the function. If you do that, the onus is on the caller to never again use the pointer he used for input. If it matches the return value, then you have two pointers to the same spot and only need to call free() on one of them. If they don't match, the input pointer now points to memory that may or may not be owned by the process. Dereferencing it could cause a segmentation fault. You could use a double pointer for the input, like this: If the caller has a duplicate of the input pointer somewhere, that duplicate still might be invalid now. I think the cleanest solution here is to avoid using realloc() when trying to modify the function caller's input. Just malloc() a new buffer, return that, and let the caller decide whether or not to free the old text. This has the added benefit of letting the caller keep the original string!","pontos":8},{"corpo":"break would stop the foreach loop completely, continue would skip to the next DataRow","pontos":12},{"corpo":" will exit the loop completely, will just skip the current iteration.

The top left entry stores the \"amplitude\" the \"base\" frequency and frequency increases both along the horizontal and vertical axes. The outcome of the DCT is usually a collection of amplitudes at the more usual lower frequencies (the top left quadrant) and less entries at the higher frequencies. As lassevk mentioned, it is usual to just zero out these higher frequencies as they typically constitute very minor parts of the source. However, this does result in loss of information. To complete the compression it is usual to use a lossless compression over the DCT'd source. This is where the compression comes in as all those runs of zeros get packed down to almost nothing. One possible advantage of using the DCT to find similar regions is that you can do a first pass match on low frequency values (top-left corner). This reduces the number of values you need to match against. If you find matches of low frequency values, you can increase into comparing the higher frequencies.

First, it creates a dependency on a particular operating system, which prevents the application from easily moving to another operating system. One of Java’s main benefits is the ability to run the same bytecode on many different platforms. Using an absolute path like this makes the code much less portable. Second, depending on the relative location of the file, this technique might create an external dependency and limit the application’s mobility. If the file exists outside the application’s current directory, this creates an external dependency and one would have to be aware of the dependency in order to move the application to another machine (error prone).

I will agree with you on the rest though, the second approach is a very bad idea because of the loss of stack trace. When I worked with .NET, I ran into many cases where other programmers did just that, and it frustrated me to no end when I needed to see the true cause of an exception, only to find it being rethrown from a huge try block where I now have no idea where the problem originated. I also second Brad's comment that you shouldn't worry about the performance. This kind of micro optimization is a HORRIBLE idea. Unless you are talking about throwing an exception in every iteration of a for loop that is running for a long time, you will more than likely not run into performance issues by the way of your exception usage. Always optimize performance when you have metrics that indicate you NEED to optimize performance, and then hit the spots that are proven to be the culprit. It is much better to have readable code with easy debugging capabilities (IE not hiding the stack trace) rather than make something run a nanosecond faster. A final note about wrapping exceptions into a custom exception... this can be a very useful construct, especially when dealing with UIs. You can wrap every known and reasonable exceptional case into some base custom exception (or one that extends from said base exception), and then the UI can just catch this base exception. When caught, the exception will need to provide means of displaying information to the user, say a ReadableMessage property, or something along those lines. Thus, any time the UI misses an exception, it is because of a bug you need to fix, and anytime it catches an exception, it is a known error condition that can and should be handled properly by the UI.","pontos":10},{"corpo":"I tried this and it works ok.

That will let you do as much of the processing in parallel, independently from the integration of the completed units of work back into the shared state.

(It is supported by the Java 1.5 and later — and I think .NET — memory model.) This means that between the time when the check takes place and when the lock (mutex) is acquired, may have already been assigned on another thread. Thread switching happens whenever the OS wants it to, not between \"lines\" of a program (which have no meaning post-compilation in most languages). Furthermore, as Matt acknowledges, he uses an as a lock rather than an OS primitive. Don't do that. Proper locks require the use of memory barrier instructions, potentially cache-line flushes, and so on; use your operating system's primitives for locking. This is especially important because the primitives used can change between the individual CPU lines that your operating system runs on; what works on a CPU Foo might not work on CPU Foo2. Most operating systems either natively support POSIX threads (pthreads) or offer them as a wrapper for the OS threading package, so it's often best to illustrate examples using them. If your operating system offers appropriate primitives, and if you absolutely need it for performance, instead of doing this type of locking/initialization you can use an atomic compare and swap operation to initialize a shared global variable. Essentially, what you write will look like this: MySingleton *MySingleton::GetSingleton() { if (pObj == NULL) { // create a temporary instance of the singleton MySingleton *temp = new MySingleton(); if (OSAtomicCompareAndSwapPtrBarrier(NULL, temp, pObj) == false) { // if the swap didn't take place, delete the temporary instance delete temp; } } return pObj; } This only works if it's safe to create multiple instances of your singleton (one per thread that happens to invoke GetSingleton() simultaneously), and then throw extras away. The function provided on Mac OS X — most operating systems provide a similar primitive — checks whether is and only actually sets it to to it if it is. This uses hardware support to really, literally only perform the swap once and tell whether it happened. Another facility to leverage if your OS offers it that's in between these two extremes is . This lets you set up a function that's run only once - basically by doing all of the locking/barrier/etc. trickery for you - no matter how many times it's invoked or on how many threads it's invoked.

Middle Monitor: code / debugging Right Monitor: Test application / scrolling logfiles (if needed) This usually works pretty well, and since the monitors are fairly big I rarely need to use the test application in full-screen, so there's plenty of room for my tail -f windows. I also use AutoHotkey to assign hotkeys that flip to the most important windows, like Firefox or my SSH session. That way I can simply use a shortcut key to access them when necessary. The left monitor is actually a separate computer running Linux and keyboard/mouse shared with Synergy, so I have multiple ebooks or documentation pages open, one on each virtual desktop... I can flip between the documentation by moving my mouse to the left and using a shortcut key.","pontos":5},{"corpo":"Basically, you're asking for synchronized creation of a singleton, without using any synchronization (previously-constructed variables). In general, no, this is not possible. You need something available for synchronization. As for your other question, yes, static variables which can be statically initialized (i.e. no runtime code necessary) are guaranteed to be initialized before other code is executed. This makes it possible to use a statically-initialized mutex to synchronize creation of the singleton. From the 2003 revision of the C++ standard: Objects with static storage duration (3.7.1) shall be zero-initialized (8.5) before any other initialization takes place. Zero-initialization and initialization with a constant expression are collectively called static initialization; all other initialization is dynamic initialization. Objects of POD types (3.9) with static storage duration initialized with constant expressions (5.19) shall be initialized before any dynamic initialization takes place. Objects with static storage duration defined in namespace scope in the same translation unit and dynamically initialized shall be initialized in the order in which their definition appears in the translation unit. If you know that you will be using this singleton during the initialization of other static objects, I think you'll find that synchronization is a non-issue. To the best of my knowledge, all major compilers initialize static objects in a single thread, so thread-safety during static initialization. You can declare your singleton pointer to be NULL, and then check to see if it's been initialized before you use it. However, this assumes that you know that you'll use this singleton during static initialization. This is also not guaranteed by the standard, so if you want to be completely safe, use a statically-initialized mutex. Edit: Chris's suggestion to use an atomic compare-and-swap would certainly work. If portability is not an issue (and creating additional temporary singletons is not a problem), then it is a slightly lower overhead solution.","pontos":12},{"corpo":"I have VS in my left monitor and the GUI/running window in the right.

Although I don't do anything formal I generally spend some time looking at each class and ensuring that: if they are in a valid state that they stay in a valid state there is no way to construct them in an invalid state Under exceptional circumstances they will fail as gracefully as possible (frequently this is a cleanup and throw)","pontos":0},{"corpo":"As others have stated, the best performance comes from the bottom one since you are just rethrowing an existing object. The middle one is least correct because it looses the stack. I personally use custom exceptions if I want to decouple certain dependencies in code.

It could fail to read from the disk (FileIOException), the user could try to access it from somewhere where they are not allowed (SecurityException), the file could be corrupt (XmlParseException), data could be in the wrong format (DeserialisationException). In this case, so its easier for the calling class to make sense of all this, all these exceptions rethrow a single custom exception (FileOperationException) so that means the caller does not need references to System.IO or System.Xml, but can still access what error occurred through an enum and any important information. As stated, don't try to micro-optimize something like this, the act of throwing an exception at all is the slowest thing that occurs here. The best improvement to make is to try avoiding an exception at all. public bool Load(string filepath) { if (File.Exists(filepath)) //Avoid throwing by checking state { //Wrap anyways in case something changes between check and operation try { .... } catch (IOException ioFault) { .... } catch (OtherException otherFault) { .... } return true; //Inform caller of success } else { return false; } //Inform caller of failure due to state } ","pontos":1},{"corpo":"Looking around, it seems some people resolved this by repairing or reinstalling the .NET SDK.

Each iteration of the loop body would create and start a thread but then immediately Join it and wait for it to finish.

In other words, the groupby iterator itself returns iterators. Here's an example of that, using clearer variable names: from itertools import groupby things = [(\"animal\", \"bear\"), (\"animal\", \"duck\"), (\"plant\", \"cactus\"), (\"vehicle\", \"speed boat\"), (\"vehicle\", \"school bus\")] for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]): for thing in group: print \"A %s is a %s.\" % (thing[1], key) print \" \" This will give you the output: A bear is a animal. A duck is a animal. A cactus is a plant. A speed boat is a vehicle. A school bus is a vehicle. In this example, \"things\" is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to. The groupby() function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with. Here, \"lambda x: x[0]\" tells groupby() to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.

That's why your XSLT has to jump through such hoops to render the data properly. Using a \"br\" tag would vastly simplify the transform. Another potential problem is that if you open up your XML document in an XML editor and pretty-print it, you're likely to lose those line breaks. If you do keep using linebreaks, make sure add an xml:space=\"preserve\" attribute to \"address.\" (You can do this in your DTD, if you're using one.)

You need to start with an \"^\" to make sure that it starts at the beginning of a line. Then you repeat ([0-9]+)\\t as often as there are columns that you just want to leave as they are. ([0-9]+),([0-9]+) searches for values where there is a number, then a comma and then another number. In the replace string we use \\1 and \\2 to just keep the values from the edited line, separating them with \\t (tab). Then we put \\3\\4 (no tab between) to put the two components of the number without the comma right after each other. All values after that will be left alone. If you need your file to have semicolon to separate the elements, you then can go on and replace the tabs with semicolons. However then - if you leave out the quotes - you'll have to make sure that the text values do not contain any semicolons themselves. That's why I prefer to use TAB as column separator.

It displays and receives data in a way that the user can relate to, and maps that output/input to and from the domain object format. The business logic tier just need to know one thing. Business logic. It does not care about where the data is from, and it does not care about where the data tier is putting it.

Whilst some people might be happy to say that looping through the collection is less efficient to throwing an exception, there is an overhead to throwing an exception. I would also question why you are using a collection to access an item by key when you would be better suited to using a dictionary or hashtable. My main problem with this code however, is that regardless of the type of exception thrown, you are always going to be left with the same result. For example, an exception could be thrown because the object doesn't exist in the collection, or because the collection itself is null or because you can't cast myCollect[myObject] to aObject. All of these exceptions will get handled in the same way, which may not be your intention. These are a couple of nice articles on when and where it is usally considered acceptable to throw exceptions: Foundations of Programming Throwing exceptions in c# I particularly like this quote from the second article: It is important that exceptions are thrown only when an unexpected or invalid activity occurs that prevents a method from completing its normal function.

Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X (this final one on different hardware) all degrade much more gracefully in terms of aggregate bandwidth when moving from one thread to two. Linux for example degraded from ~45 MiB/sec to ~42 MiB/sec. These other operating systems must be reading larger chunks of the file between each seek, and therefor not spending nearly all their time waiting on the disk to seek. Our solution for Windows is to pass the flag to and use large (~16MiB) reads in each call to . This is suboptimal for several reasons: Files don't get cached when read like this, so there are none of the advantages that caching normally gives. The constraints when working with this flag are much more complicated than normal reading (alignment of read buffers to page boundaries, etc). (As a final remark. Does this explain why swapping under Windows is so hellish? Ie, Windows is incapable of doing IO to multiple files concurrently with any efficiency, so while swapping all other IO operations are forced to be disproportionately slow.) Edit to add some further details for Will Dean: Of course across these different hardware configurations the raw figures did change (sometimes substantially). The problem however is the consistent degradation in performance that only Windows suffers when moving from one thread to two. Here is a summary of the machines tested: Several Dell workstations (Intel Xeon) of various ages running Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit), and Windows XP (64-bit) with single drive. A Dell 1U server (Intel Xeon) running Windows Server 2003 (64-bit) with RAID 1+0. An HP workstation (AMD Opteron) with Windows XP (64-bit), and Windows Server 2003, and hardware RAID 5.

My home Koolu PC running Linux. Vastly underpowered compared to the other systems but I demonstrated that even this machine can outperform a Windows server with RAID5 when doing multi-threaded disk reads.

In my experience, there are two key things that can help keep your personal server secure enough to throw up on the internet while retaining your sanity: 1) Security through obscurity Needless to say, relying on this in the 'real world' is a bad idea and not to be entertained. But that's because in the real world, baddies know what's there and that there's loot to be had. On a personal server, the majority of 'attacks' you'll suffer will simply be automated sweeps from machines that have already been compromised, looking for default installations of products known to be vulnerable. If your server doesn't offer up anything enticing on the default ports or in the default locations, the automated attacker will move on. Therefore, if you're going to run a ssh server, put it on a non-standard port (>1024) and it's likely it will never be found. If you can get away with this technique for your web server then great, shift that to an obscure port too. 2) Package management Don't compile and install Apache or sshd from source yourself unless you absolutely have to. If you do, you're taking on the responsibility of keeping up-to-date with the latest security patches. Let the nice package maintainers from Linux distros such as Debian or Ubuntu do the work for you. Install from the distro's precompiled packages, and staying current becomes a matter of issuing the occasional apt-get update apt-get -u dist-upgrade command, or using whatever fancy GUI tool Ubuntu provides.

That's fine when it's appropriate. If you need a bunch of worker threads, though, all you've done is make your code more complicated. Now you have to write code to manage them. If you just used a thread pool, you'd get all the thread management for free. And the thread pool provided by the language is very likely to be more robust, more efficient, and less buggy than whatever you roll for yourself. Thread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(DoSomething)); t.Start(); t.Join(); I hope that you would normally have some additional code in between and . Otherwise, the extra thread is useless, and you're wasting resources for no reason. People are way too afraid of the resources used by threads. I've never seen creating and starting a thread to take more than a millisecond. There is no hard limit on the number of threads you can create. RAM usage is minimal. Once you have a few hundred threads, CPU becomes an issue because of context switches, so at that point you might want to get fancy with your design. A millisecond is a long time on modern hardware. That's 3 million cycles on a 3GHz machine. And again, you aren't the only one creating threads. Your threads compete for the CPU along with every other program's threads. If you use not-quite-too-many threads, and so does another program, then together you've used too many threads. Seriously, don't make life more complex than it needs to be. Don't use the thread pool unless you need something very specific that it offers. Indeed. Don't make life more complex. If your program needs multiple worker threads, don't reinvent the wheel.

Are you the only target customer for the programs you write? If not, you can't be certain about most of that. You generally have no idea when you write a program whether it will execute effectively solo, or if it will run on a webserver being hammered by a DDOS attack. You can't know how much CPU time you are going to have. Assuming your program's behavior changes based on input, it's rare to even know exactly how much memory or CPU time your program will consume. Sure, you should have a pretty good idea about how your program is going to behave, but most programs are never analyzed to determine exactly how much memory, how many handles, etc. will be used, because a full analysis is expensive. If you aren't writing real-time software, the payoff isn't worth the effort. In general, claiming to know exactly how your program will behave is far-fetched, and claiming to know everything about the machine approaches ludicrous. And to be honest, if you don't know exactly what method you should use: manual threads, thread pool, delegates, and how to implement it to do just what your application needs, you are in trouble. I don't fully disagree, but I don't really see how that's relevant. This site is here specifically because programmers don't always have all the answers. If your application is complex enough to require throttling the number of threads that you use, aren't you almost always going to want more control than what the framework gives you? No. If I need a thread pool, I will use the one that's provided, unless and until I find that it is not sufficient. I will not simply assume that the provided thread pool is insufficient for my needs without confirming that to be the case. I'm not speaking as someone with only theoretical knowledge here. I write and maintain high volume applications that make heavy use of multithreading, and I generally don't find the thread pool to be the correct answer. Most of my professional experience has been with multithreading and multiprocessing programs. I have often needed to roll my own solution as well.

Here I simply instantiate the controls, grab their html and output it, I will follow with thoughts on designer support etc.. Page Code-Behind protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { // Create some controls (BadControl will throw) string goodHtml = SafeLoader.LoadControl(new BadControl()); Response.Write(goodHtml); string badHtml = SafeLoader.LoadControl(new GoodControl()); Response.Write(badHtml); } Thoughts OK, I know what you are thinking, \"these controls are instantiated programatically, what about designer support?

Again, sorry for the long post, but I wanted to get the code here so we can discuss this :) I hope this helps demonstrate my idea :) Update Tested by chucking a control in on the designer and overriding the CreateChildControls method with this, works fine, may need some clean up to make things better looking, but I'll leave that to you ;) protected override void CreateChildControls() { // Pass each control through the Loader to check // its not lame foreach (Control ctl in Controls) { string s = SafeLoader.LoadControl(ctl); // If its bad, smack it downnnn! if (s == string.Empty) { ctl.Visible = false; // Prevent Rendering string ctlType = ctl.GetType().Name; Response.Write(\" b Problem Occurred Rendering \" + ctlType + \" '\" + ctl.ID + \"'. /b \"); } } } Enjoy!

Since the s_Initialized field is essentially \"write once\" it will never return a false positive. It's economical to read it outside the lock.

IDisposable is a pattern for freeing unmanaged resources -- and memory is quite definitely a managed resource. The links pointing to GC.Collect() are the correct answer, though use of this function is generally discouraged by the Microsoft .NET documentation. Edit: Having earned a substantial amount of karma for this answer, I feel a certain responsibility to elaborate on it, lest a newcomer to .NET resource management get the wrong impression. Inside a .NET process, there are two kinds of resource -- managed and unmanaged. \"Managed\" means that the runtime is in control of the resource, while \"unmanaged\" means that it's the programmer's responsibility. And there really is only one kind of managed resource that we care about in .NET today -- memory. The programmer tells the runtime to allocate memory and after that it's up to the runtime to figure out when the memory can freed. The mechanism that .NET uses for this purpose is called garbage collection and you can find plenty of information about GC on the internet simply by using Google. For the other kinds of resources, .NET doesn't know anything about cleaning them up so it has to rely on the programmer to do the right thing. To this end, the platform gives the programmer three tools: The IDisposable interface and the \"using\" statement in VB and C# Finalizers The IDisposable pattern as implemented by many BCL classes The first of these allows the programmer to efficiently acquire a resource, use it and then release it all within the same method. using (DisposableObject tmp = DisposableObject.AcquireResource()) { // Do something with tmp } // At this point, tmp.Dispose() will automatically have been called // BUT, tmp may still a perfectly valid object that still takes up memory If \"AcquireResource\" is a factory method that (for instance) opens a file and \"Dispose\" automatically closes the file, then this code cannot leak a file resource. But the memory for the \"tmp\" object itself may well still be allocated. That's because the IDisposable interface has absolutely no connection to the garbage collector. If you did want to ensure that the memory was freed, your only option would be to call to force a garbage collection. However, it cannot be stressed enough that this is probably not a good idea. It's generally much better to let the garbage collector do what it was designed to do, which is to manage memory. What happens if the resource is being used for a longer period of time, such that its lifespan crosses several methods? Clearly, the \"using\" statement is no longer applicable, so the programmer would have to manually call \"Dispose\" when he or she is done with the resource. And what happens if the programmer forgets? If there's no fallback, then the process or computer may eventually run out of whichever resource isn't being properly freed. That's where finalizers come in. A finalizer is a method on your class that has a special relationship with the garbage collector. The GC promises that -- before freeing the memory for any object of that type -- it will first give the finalizer a chance to do some kind of cleanup. So in the case of a file, we theoretically don't need to close the file manually at all. We can just wait until the garbage collector gets to it and then let the finalizer do the work. Unfortunately, this doesn't work well in practice because the garbage collector runs non-deterministically. The file may stay open considerably longer than the programmer expects. And if enough files are kept open, the system may fail when trying to open an additional file. For most resources, we want both of these things. We want a convention to be able to say \"we're done with this resource now\" and we want to make sure that there's at least some chance for the cleanup to happen automatically if we forget to do it manually. That's where the \"IDisposable\" pattern comes into play. This is a convention that allows IDispose and a finalizer to play nicely together. You can see how the pattern works by looking at the official documentation for IDisposable. Bottom line: If what you really want to do is to just make sure that memory is freed, then IDisposable and finalizers will not help you. But the IDisposable interface is part of an extremely important pattern that all .NET programmers should understand. ","pontos":78},{"corpo":"I am assuming that you want unit testing in MSSQL.

How to understand whether your application leaks One interesting way is to open perfmon and add traces for # bytes in all heaps and # Gen 2 collections , in each case looking just at your process. If exercising a particular feature causes the total bytes to increase, and that memory remains allocated after the next Gen 2 collection, you might say that the feature leaks memory. How to prevent Other good opinions have been given. I would just add that perhaps the most commonly overlooked cause of .NET memory leaks is to add event handlers to objects without removing them. An event handler attached to an object is a form of reference to that object, so will prevent collection even after all other references have gone. Always remember to detach event handlers (using the syntax in C#). Does the leak go away when the process exits, and what about COM interop? When your process exits, all memory mapped into its address space is reclaimed by the OS, including any COM objects served from DLLs. Comparatively rarely, COM objects can be served from separate processes. In this case, when your process exits, you may still be responsible for memory allocated in any COM server processes that you used.

You might recognize this as the Bottom-Up approach. But Unix takes this philosophy to an extreme. It's like living in a foreign country: you need to enculturate. For instance, suppose you are working on a system that requires three separate servers. Every morning, you type in three different commands to start them up. At some point (hopefully on day two), you decide it's silly to type those same three commands each time you want to start work. You might be tempted to write an application that controls those servers, but that's not the Unix way. Instead, you should put those three commands in a script and move on. Later, when you are ready to go into production, you want to show the startup process to your customer. It's a bit embarrassing to show off the startup script, so you write a little GUI that has a startup button for the customer to press. That button simply calls the script you wrote back on day two. Problem solved! If that scenario strikes you as odd or horrifying, you are still thinking like a Windows programmer. And in some ways it is horrifying: a little helper script has become part of production code almost by accident. But this sort of thing happens all the time on Unix systems and it mostly works. There's not much point in listing commands that you need. If you use the command line long enough, you'll figure out what you need fairly quickly. Instead, I'd focus on trying to do everything in the shell for a while. (I use ksh exclusively for writing scripts and bash for my interactive shell. They're similar, but geared toward slightly different uses.) I don't believe anyone who does not understand pipelines can be said to be a Unix programmer. A fairly common idiom that I found helpful to grokking pipelines was the output of find piped into xargs. Right now, for instance, I need to remove a bunch of files that I own. First I find the files: $ find . -user jericson Then I pipe the results to xargs to remove them: $ find . -user jericson | xargs rm Be sure to look at the -i option for xargs as well. Note that I broke the problem into two smaller problems and solved each one separately. I actually ran the find command by itself to be sure I was looking at correct files.

You could try to generate the future events on demand, and populate the future events only when necessary to display them or to send notification about them. However, if you are going to build the \"on-demand\" generation code anyway, why not use it all the time? Instead of pulling from the event table, and then having to use on-demand event generation to fill in any new events that haven't been added to the table yet, just use the on-demand event generation exclusively. The end result will be the same. With this scheme, you only need to store the start and end dates and the event frequency. I don't see any way that you can avoid having on-demand event generation, so I can't see the utility in the event table. If you want it for the sake of caching, then I think you're taking the wrong approach. First, it's a poor cache because you can't avoid on-demand event generation anyway. Second, you should probably be caching at a higher level anyway. If you want to cache, then cache generated pages, not events. As far as making your polling more efficient, if you are only polling every 15 minutes, and your database and/or server can't handle the load, then you are already doomed.

In C#, long maps to System.Int64, but in a different programming language, long could map to an Int16 or Int32. In fact, C++/CLI does in fact treat long as an Int32. Someone reading source code in one language could easily misinterpret the code's intention if he or she were used to programming in a different programming language. In fact, most languages won't even treat long as a keyword and won't compile code that uses it. The FCL has many methods that have type names as part of their method names. For example, the BinaryReader type offers methods such as ReadBoolean, ReadInt32, ReadSingle, and so on, and the System.Convert type offers methods such as ToBoolean, ToInt32, ToSingle, and so on. Although it's legal to write the following code, the line with float feels very unnatural to me, and it's not obvious that the line is correct: BinaryReader br = new BinaryReader(...); float val = br.ReadSingle(); // Ok, but feels unnatural Single val = br.ReadSingle(); // OK and feels good So there you have it. I think these are all really good points. I however, don't find myself using Jeffrey's advice in my own code. Maybe I am too stuck in my C# world but I end up trying to make my code look like the framework code.

He doesn't need a hierarchy of objects and interfaces; he needs a way to look up a schedule based on a season and a group identifier. Turning things into objects only makes sense if they have responsibilities or state. If they have neither, then they are simply identifiers, and building special objects for them just makes the codebase larger. You could build, e.g., objects that each contain a set of schedule strings (one for each season), but if all the object does is provide lookup functionality, then you've reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion. If he has to look up the group, and then lookup the schedule, all he has is a two-step lookup table that took longer to code, is more likely to be buggy, and will be harder to maintain.

Depending on the language implementation, it can be slower and more memory intensive than just using primitives. However, it may also allow you to use higher level data structures and achieve greater flexibility in your code.

Each value in the second list is actually a reference to an that holds the . This is called boxed because the is wrapped by the . When its cast back the is unboxed - converted back to it's value. For value types (i.e. all ) this is slow, and potentially uses a lot more space. For reference types (i.e. all ) this is far less of a problem, as they are stored as a reference anyway. A further problem with a boxed value type is that it's not obvious that you're dealing with the box, rather than the value. When you compare two then you're comparing values, but when you compare two then (by default) you're comparing the reference - i.e. are these the same instance?

Also 100% coverage (of lines, paths, conditions...) doesn't tell you you've hit all boundary conditions. Most importantly, the test cases are not write-and-forget. Each time you find a bug, write an additional test. Check it fails with the original program, check it passes with the corrected program and add it to your test set. An excerpt from The Art of Software Testing by Glenford J. Myers: If an input condition specifies a range of values, write test cases for the ends of the range, and invalid-input test cases for situations just beyond the ends. If an input condition specifies a number of values, write test cases for the minimum and maximum number of values and one beneath and beyond these values. Use guideline 1 for each output condition. Use guideline 2 for each output condition. If the input or output of a program is an ordered set focus attention on the first and last elements of the set. In addition, use your ingenuity to search for other boundary conditions (I've only pasted the bare minimum for copyright reasons.) Points 3. and 4. above are very important. People tend to forget boundary conditions for the outputs. 5. is OK. 6. really doesn't help :-) Short exam This is more difficult than it looks. Myers offers this test: The program reads three integer values from an input dialog. The three values represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program displays a message that states whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral. Remember that a scalene triangle is one where no two sides are equal, whereas an isosceles triangle has two equal sides, and an equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length. Moreover, the angles opposite the equal sides in an isosceles triangle also are equal (it also follows that the sides opposite equal angles in a triangle are equal), and all angles in an equilateral triangle are equal. Write your test cases. How many do you have? Myers asks 14 questions about your test set and reports that highly qualified professional programmes average 7.8 out of a possible 14.

I don't think this highlights a problem with any framework or CMS other than the need to do profiling and load-testing on any site which is going to get significant traffic. In both cases it was what the developer had done, rather than the characteristics of the software platform, that caused the problem. For example, there was a recursive function call the developer had created in the Cake project which instantiated the entire Cake object every recursion and this would have taken out the server had it gone live under load. In my opinion performance should not be a deciding factor in choosing a framework; the objective differences are likely to be marginal and the way you use it is likely to cause far more performance problems than the inherent performance of the framework.

The GC will only run when it determines the need to (called memory pressure) and then (and only then) will it deallocate memory for unused objects and compact the memory space.

When you force an out-of-band collection cycle like this you actually cause the GC to do more work and ultimately can end up hurting your applications performance.

That way, you can stop observing immediately when the thing doing the observing is no longer needed, regardless of when it's actually deallocated.

","pontos":36},{"corpo":"Think of a database as a great big object - after each call to it, it ought to be in a logically consistent state. Databases expose themselves via tables, and keeping tables and rows consistent can be done with triggers. Another way to keep them consistent is to disallow direct access to the tables, and only allowing it through stored procedures and views. The downside of triggers is that any action can invoke them; this is also a strength - no-one is going to screw up the integrity of the system through incompetence. As a counterpoint, allowing access to a database only through stored procedures and views still allows the backdoor access of permissions. Users with sufficient permissions are trusted not to break database integrity, all others use stored procedures. As to reducing the amount of work: databases are stunningly efficient when they don't have to deal with the outside world; you'd be really surprised how much even process switching hurts performance.

You need to add a whole bunch of logic in there to cater for that situation. Once you start doing that you lose the benefits of the stored procedure in that scenario. Business logic has to go somewhere, and there's a lot of implied domain rules embedded in the design of a database - relations, constraints and so on are an attempt to codify business rules by saying, for example, a user can only have one password. Given you've started shoving business rules onto the database server by having these relations and so on, where do you draw the line? When does the database give up responsibility for the integrity of the data, and start trusting the calling apps and database users to get it right? Stored procedures with these rules embedded in them can push a lot of political power into the hands of the DBAs. It comes down to how many tiers are going to exist in your n-tier architecture; if there's a presentation, business and data layer, where does the separation between business and data lie? What value-add does the business layer add? Will you run the business layer on the database server as stored procedures?

To be clear, leaked memory is memory that is reserved by a program, then abandoned (ie, a pointer is left dangling), and which subsequently cannot be freed. Since memory is managed in .NET, this is theoretically impossible. It is possible, however, for a program to reserve an ever-increasing amount of memory without allowing references to it to go out of scope (and become eligible for garbage collection); however that memory is not leaked. The GC will return it to the system once your program exits. So. To answer your question, I don't think you actually have a problem here.

But with managed code, new meaning to the term Memory Leak might be more appropiate... Microsoft even acknowledges it to be a memory leak: Why Implement the WeakEvent Pattern? Listening for events can lead to memory leaks. The typical technique for listening to an event is to use the language-specific syntax that attaches a handler to an event on a source. For instance, in C#, that syntax is: source.SomeEvent += new SomeEventHandler(MyEventHandler). This technique creates a strong reference from the event source to the event listener. Ordinarily, attaching an event handler for a listener causes the listener to have an object lifetime that influenced by the object lifetime for the source (unless the event handler is explicitly removed). But in certain circumstances you might want the object lifetime of the listener to be controlled only by other factors, such as whether it currently belongs to the visual tree of the application, and not by the lifetime of the source. Whenever the source object lifetime extends beyond the object lifetime of the listener, the normal event pattern leads to a memory leak: the listener is kept alive longer than intended. We use WPF for a client app with large ToolWindows that can be dragged dropped, all the nifty stuff, and all compatible with in a XBAP.. But we had the same problem with some ToolWindows that weren't garbadge collected.. This was due to the fact that it was still dependent on event listeners..

I know there aren't many real differences between the two, but I don't want to pay you to learn the new syntax. For your specific question: I've asked that type of question before and what I wanted to hear about was how the underlying system and framework were the same. If possible, talk about garbage collection, IDisposable, finalizers, the dangers of unsafe code blocks, stack vs heap, etc. All the kind of stuff to show that you really understand the intricacies of the .Net framework. Right or wrong, the heritage of VB brings with it an expectation of a lack of understand of lower level programming and windows in general (which, ironically enough, a c++ developer would have of a c# developer... and so on). Lastly, how you frame your experience can make a world of difference. If you position yourself as a .Net developer, rather than VB.Net or C#, the stupid, pseudo-religious, banter may not enter the conversation. This of course requires that you actually know both VB.Net and C# at the time of the interview, but that's a good policy regardless. The truth of the matter is that if you find that the person interviewing you writes you off simply because you've previously been developing in VB.Net, it's likely not going to be a place you want to work at anyway.

The number of times you can 'transparently' change the SQL out from underneath your app is pretty small on the whole You end up reusing SQL code. Programming languages, C# included, have this amazing thing, called a function. It means you can invoke the same block of code from multiple places! Amazing! You can then put the re-usable SQL code inside one of these, or if you want to get really high tech, you can use a library which does it for you. I believe they're called Object Relational Mappers, and are pretty common these days. Code repetition is the worst thing you can do when you're trying to build a maintainable application! Agreed, which is why storedprocs are a bad thing. It's much easier to refactor and decompose (break into smaller parts) code into functions than SQL into... blocks of SQL? You have 4 webservers and a bunch of windows apps which use the same SQL code Now you realized there is a small problem with the SQl code so do you rather...... change the proc in 1 place or push the code to all the webservers, reinstall all the desktop apps(clickonce might help) on all the windows boxes Why are your windows apps connecting directly to a central database? That seems like a HUGE security hole right there, and bottleneck as it rules out server-side caching. Shouldn't they be connecting via a web service or similar to your web servers? So, push 1 new sproc, or 4 new webservers? In this case it is easier to push one new sproc, but in my experience, 95% of 'pushed changes' affect the code and not the database. If you're pushing 20 things to the webservers that month, and 1 to the database, you hardly lose much if you instead push 21 things to the webservers, and zero to the database. More easily code reviewed. Can you explain how? I don't get this. Particularly seeing as the sprocs probably aren't in source control, and therefore can't be accessed via web-based SCM browsers and so on. More cons: Storedprocs live in the database, which appears to the outside world as a black box. Simple things like wanting to put them in source control becomes a nightmare. There's also the issue of sheer effort.

My general answer is a series of Regular Expressions, though the complexity of this depends on the answer.

Because there are errors you won't get 100% accuracy, but there are a few things you can do to get most of the way there, and then do a visual BS test. Here's the general way to go about it. It's not code, because it's pretty academic to write it, there's no weirdness, just lots of string handling. (Now that you've posted some sample data, I've made some minor changes) Work backward. Start from the zip code, which will be near the end, and in one of two known formats: XXXXX or XXXXX-XXXX. If this doesn't appear, you can assume you're in the city, state portion, below. The next thing, before the zip, is going to be the state, and it'll be either in a two-letter format, or as words. You know what these will be, too -- there's only 50 of them. Also, you could soundex the words to help compensate for spelling errors. before that is the city, and it's probably on the same line as the state. You could use a zip-code database to check the city and state based on the zip, or at least use it as a BS detector. The street address will generally be one or two lines. The second line will generally be the suite number if there is one, but it could also be a PO box. It's going to be near-impossible to detect a name on the first or second line, though if it's not prefixed with a number (or if it's prefixed with an \"attn:\" or \"attention to:\" it could give you a hint as to whether it's a name or an address line.

If no Zip Code was found Error. Trim the end then for spaces and special chars (commas) Then move on to State, again use the Space as the delimiter. Maybe use a lookup list to validate 2 letter state codes, and full state names. If no valid state found, error. Trim spaces and commas from the end again. City gets tricky, I would actually use a comma here, at the risk of getting too much data in the city. Look for the comma, or beginning of the line.

Also, make sure that the connection strings have permissions on the other DB, otherwise this will not work.

Anything to the left of that number is likely an addressee. You should now have the City, State, Zip stored in a table and possibly two strings, addressee and address. For the address, check for the existence of \"Suite\" or \"Apt.\" etc. and split that into two values (address lines 1 2). For the addressee I would punt and grab the last word of that string as the last name and put the rest into the first name field.

The statement above becomes: select ... from [tablename] where [FieldName] 15 --this line was 'read' from the lambda function This is different from normal methods or anonymous delegates (which are just compiler magic really) because they cannot be read.

But we've had cases where we had minor issues with a report's layout, like having a table bleed into the page's margins, that resulted in the SSRS PDF renderer \"throwing up its hands\" and rendering the table as an image instead of as text. Obviously, the fewer graphics in your report, the smaller your file size will be. 2. Is there a way that you could easily break the report into pieces? E.g., if it's a 10-location report, where Location 1 is followed by Location 2, etc., on your final report, could you run the Location 1 portion independent of the Location 2 portion, etc.? If so, you could join the 10 sub-reports into one final PDF using PDFSharp after you've received them all. This leads to some difficulties with page numbering, but nothing insurmountable. 3. Does anyone else have any other theories as to why this runs on the server but not through the API? My guess would be the sheer size of the report.

Assuming you're working on a small team where communication and collaboration is good and releases are frequent, it makes very little sense to ever branch IMO. On one project we simply rolled the SVN revision number into the product version number for all our releases and we never even tagged. In the rare event that there was a critical bug found in prod we would simply branch straight from the revision that was released.

To do a full outer join with filtering on one of the tables, you need to put your WHERE clause into a subquery, so the filtering happens before the join, or try to build all of your WHERE criteria onto the JOIN ON clause, which is insanely ugly. Well, there's actually no pretty way to do this one. @Jonas: Considering this: Also, the report is actually for financial year - so I would love to have empty columns with 0 in both if there was no sales in say month 5 for either 2007 or 2008. and the fact that this job can't be done with a pretty query, I would definitely try to get the results you actually want. No point in having an ugly query and not even getting the exact data you actually want. ;) So, I'd suggest doing this in 5 steps: 1. create a temp table in the format you want your results to match 2. populate it with twelve rows, with 1-12 in the month column 3. update the \"This Year\" column using your SP1 logic 4. update the \"Last Year\" column using your SP2 logic 5. select from the temp table Of course, I guess I'm working from the assumption that you can create a stored procedure to accomplish this. You might technically be able to run this whole batch inline, but that kind of ugliness is very rarely seen.

I have access to create stored procedures and functions on the reporting database. I created a Table Valued function accepting a product category and a financial year as the parameter. Based on that the function will populate a table containing 12 rows. The rows will be populated with data from the view if any sales available, if not the row will have 0 values. I then join the two tables returned by the functions. Since I know all tables will have twelve roves it's allot easier, and I can join on Product Category and Month: SELECT SP1.Program, SP1.Year, SP1.Month, SP1.TotalRevenue AS ThisYearRevenue, SP2.TotalRevenue AS LastYearRevenue FROM GetFinancialYear(@Category, 'First Look', 2008) AS SP1 RIGHT JOIN GetFinancialYear(@Category, 'First Look', 2007) AS SP2 ON SP1.Program = SP2.Program AND SP1.Month = SP2.Month I think your approach is probably a little cleaner as the GetFinancialYear function is quite messy!

The fact that we can formalize the relationship by a declarative constraint is very powerful. @John - Other databases may automatically create indexes for foreign keys, but SQL Server does not. In SQL Server, foreign key relationships are only constraints. You must defined your index on foreign keys separately (which can be of benefit.) Edit: I'd like to add that, IMO, the use of foreign keys in support of ON DELETE or ON UPDATE CASCADE is not necessarily a good thing. In practice, I have found that cascade on delete should be carefully considered based on the relationship of the data -- e.g. do you have a natural parent-child where this may be OK or is the related table a set of lookup values.

Look for large numbers of rows coming into an operator, but small numbers coming out. Usually, an index would help by limiting the number of rows coming in (which saves disk reads). Focus on the largest cost subtree first. Changing that subtree can often change the entire query plan. Common problems I've seen are: If there's a lot of joins, sometimes Sql Server will choose to expand the joins, and then apply WHERE clauses. You can usually fix this by moving the WHERE conditions into the JOIN clause, or a derived table with the conditions inlined. Views can cause the same problems. Suboptimal joins (LOOP vs HASH vs MERGE). My rule of thumb is to use a LOOP join when the top row has very few rows compared to the bottom, a MERGE when the sets are roughly equal and ordered, and a HASH for everything else. Adding a join hint will let you test your theory. Parameter sniffing. If you ran the stored proc with unrealistic values at first (say, for testing), then the cached query plan may be suboptimal for your production values. Running again WITH RECOMPILE should verify this. For some stored procs, especially those that deal with varying sized ranges (say, all dates between today and yesterday - which would entail an INDEX SEEK - or, all dates between last year and this year - which would be better off with an INDEX SCAN) you may have to run it WITH RECOMPILE every time. Bad indentation...Okay, so Sql Server doesn't have an issue with this - but I sure find it impossible to understand a query until I've fixed up the formatting.

The savings can be enormous: http://www.akadia.com/services/ora_bind_variables.html. I work mostly with Oracle, but Microsoft SQL Server works pretty much the same way. In my experience, if you don't know whether or not you are using bind variables, you probably aren't. If your application language doesn't support them, find one that does. Sometimes you can fix query A by using bind variables for query B. After that, I talk to our DBA to find out what's causing the RDBMS the most pain. Note that you shouldn't ask \"Why is this query slow?\" That's like asking your doctor to take out you appendix. Sure your query might be the problem, but it's just as likely that something else is going wrong. As developers, we we tend to think in terms of lines of code. If a line is slow, fix that line. But a RDBMS is a really complicated system and your slow query might be the symptom of a much larger problem. Way too many SQL tuning tips are cargo cult idols. Most of the time the problem is unrelated or minimally related to the syntax you use, so it's normally best to use the cleanest syntax you can. Then you can start looking at ways to tune the database (not the query). Only tweak the syntax when that fails. Like any performance tuning, always collect meaningful statistics.

At this point, we already had dbChanges_n+1.sql in the Trunk, so we ended up going with a scheme like the following: dbChanges_n.1.sql dbChanges_n.2.sql ... dbChanges_n.3.sql Again, this worked well enough, until we one day we looked up and saw 42 delta scripts in the mainline and 10 in the branch.

So we can turn this: /^([+-]?)(\\d+\\.\\d+|\\d+\\.|\\.\\d+|\\d+)([eE][+-]?\\d+)?$/; into this: / ^ ([+-]?) # first, match an optional sign ( # then match integers or f.p. mantissas: \\d+\\.\\d+ # mantissa of the form a.b |\\d+\\. # mantissa of the form a. |\\.\\d+ # mantissa of the form .b |\\d+ # integer of the form a ) ([eE][+-]?\\d+)? # finally, optionally match an exponent $ /x; Which I might add (as far as I know) is not available in any other general purpose Regular Expression librarys, accessible within other languages. So in other words if you are using another language you are stuck with the first form, or you have to write significantly more code to achieve the same ends, which will be error prone. See here for more information. Actually Perl can be very powerful, imagine running arbitrary code, from within a Regex. Don't worry you're not allowed to use interpolation with this feature, by default. Also this feature, last I heard is experimental, although I would bet it will stay in the language in some form or another. I know for a fact, it is a feature of Perl 6. $x =~ /(?{print \"Hi Mom!\";})/; # matches, # prints 'Hi Mom!' Yet another useful feature: Named back-references ( copied directly from perldoc perlretut ) Perl 5.10 also introduced named capture buffers and named backreferences. To attach a name to a capturing group, you write either or . The backreference may then be written as . It is permissible to attach the same name to more than one group, but then only the leftmost one of the eponymous set can be referenced. Outside of the pattern a named capture buffer is accessible through the hash. Assuming that we have to match calendar dates which may be given in one of the three formats , or y, we can write three suitable patterns where we use , and respectively as the names of the buffers capturing the pertaining components of a date. The matching operation combines the three patterns as alternatives: $fmt1 = '(? year \\d\\d\\d\\d)-(? mon \\d\\d)-(? day \\d\\d)'; $fmt2 = '(? mon \\d\\d)/(? day \\d\\d)/(? year \\d\\d\\d\\d)'; $fmt3 = '(? day \\d\\d)\\.(? mon \\d\\d)\\.(? year \\d\\d\\d\\d)'; for my $d qw( 2006-10-21 15.01.2007 10/31/2005 ){ if ( $d =~ m{$fmt1|$fmt2|$fmt3} ){ print \"day=$+{day} month=$+{mon} year=$+{year}\\n\"; } } prints: day=21 month=10 year=2006 day=15 month=01 year=2007 day=31 month=10 year=2005 If any of the alternatives matches, the hash is bound to contain the three key-value pairs. Perl 6 If we take the number matching Regex from above and convert it to a Perl 6 Grammar, it becomes even easier to read. Perl 6 grammar Date { rule year{ \\d{4} } rule day{ \\d{1,2} } rule month{ \\d{1,2} } rule ymd{ year - month - day } rule mdy{ month / day / year } rule dmy{ day . month . year } rule match{ (ymd) | (mdy) | (dmy) } } Note: I probably have some mistakes in this last bit of code, due to the Perl 6 design changing, and because I also haven't written a lot of Perl 6 code yet. It is also a bit of a contrived example You would also need to change the for loop also. for [qw( 2006-10-21 15.01.2007 10/31/2005 )] - $d { if ( $d =~ Date.match ){ print \"day=$ day month=$ mon year=$ year \\n\"; } } prints: day=21 month=10 year=2006 day=15 month=01 year=2007 day=31 month=10 year=2005 ","pontos":74},{"corpo":"You could try Simple State Machine.

However, if both the service and client use an object that has the exact same domain behavior on both sides, you probably didn't need a service in the first place. lomax: I have to disagree with this as it's a somewhat narrow comment. Using a webservice that can serialize domain objects to XML means that it makes it easy for clients that work with the same domain objects, but it also means that those clients are restricted to using that particular web service you've exposed and it also works in reverse by allowing other clients to have no knowledge of your domain objects but still interact with your service via XML. @ Lomax: You've described two scenarios. Scenario 1: The client is rehydrating the xml message back into the exact same domain object. I consider this to be \"returning an object\". In my experience this is a bad choice and I'll explain this below. Scenario 2: The client rehydrates the xml message into something other than the exact same domain object: I am 100% behind this, however I don't consider this to be returning a domain object. It's really sending a message or DTO. Now let me explain why true/pure/not DTO object serialization across a web service is usually a bad idea. An assertion: in order to do this in the first place, you either have to be the owner of both the client and the service, or provide the client with a library to use so that they can rehydrate the object back into it's true type. The problem: This domain object as a type now exists in and belongs to two semi-related domains. Over time, behaviors may need to be added in one domain that make no sense in the other domain and this leads to pollution and potentially painful problems. I usually default to scenario 2.

This attribute is defined like this: [AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets::Class)] public ref class ControlDescriptionAttribute : Attribute { public: ControlDescriptionAttribute (String ^name, String ^description) : _name (name), _description (description) { } property String ^Name { String ^get () { return _name; } } property String ^Description { String ^get () { return _description; } } private: String ^ _name, ^ _description; }; and I apply it to a class like this: [ControlDescription (\"Pie Chart\", \"Displays a pie chart\")] public ref class PieControl sealed : UserControl { // stuff }; which is what the previous posters have said.

It is true that an abstract class (or even a non-abstract class) can be used to establish an interface to your code, but proper interfaces (the ones you define with the keyword and that only contain method signatures) are just plain easier to sort through and read. That being said, I tend to use discretion when deciding whether or not to use an interface over a class. Sometimes I want default method implementations, or variables that will be common to all subclasses. Of course, the point about multiple-interface implementation is a sound one, too. If you have a class that implements multiple interfaces, you can use an object of that class as different types in the same application. The fact that your question is about PHP, though, makes things a bit more interesting. Typing to interfaces is still not incredibly necessary in PHP, where you can pretty much feed anything to any method, regardless of its type. You can statically type method parameters, but some of that is broken (String, I believe, causes some hiccups). Couple this with the fact that you can't type most other references, and there isn't much value in trying to force static typing in PHP (at this point). And because of that, the value of interfaces in PHP, at this point is far less than it is in more strongly-typed languages. They have the benefit of readability, but little else. Multiple-implementation isn't even beneficial, because you still have to declare the methods and give them bodies within the implementor.

I started to write it with the outer join, but then saw in his sample output the count and thought that was what he wanted, and the count would not return correctly if the tables are outer joined. Not to mention that joins can cause your records to be multiplied (1 entry from tbl1 that matches 2 entries in tbl2 = 2 returns) which can be unintended. So I guess it really boils down to the specifics on what your query needs to return. UPDATE from Aug 21 '08 at 22:07: To answer the other parts of your question - is a VB function the way to go? No. Absolutely not. Not for something this simple. Functions are very bad on performance, each row in the return set executes the function. If you want to \"compartmentalize\" the different parts of the query you have to approach it more like a stored procedure.

Every time a row is modified by a specific transaction, the instance of the Database Engine stores a version of the previously committed image of the row in tempdb. Each version is marked with the transaction sequence number of the transaction that made the change. The versions of modified rows are chained using a link list. The newest row value is always stored in the current database and chained to the versioned rows stored in tempdb. For short-running transactions, a version of a modified row may get cached in the buffer pool without getting written into the disk files of the tempdb database.

You'll probably find, however, that this is somewhat rare and that it is indicative of using exceptions to control logic -- which is inefficient (slow) and often frowned upon. So using your example, if you want to run some special logic when the email server is not configured, you may want to add a method to the emailUtil object like: public bool isEmailConfigured() ... call that first, instead of looking for a specific exception. When an exception does happen, it really means that the situation was completely unexpected and the code can't handle it -- so the best you can do is report it to the user (or write it to a log or restart ) As for having an exception hierarchy vs exceptions-with-error-codes-in-them, I typically do the latter.

Personally, I think exceptions are strictly for when you can't implement a normal code solution. The performance hit and handling restrictions are just a bit too much for me. Another reason for using a list of status objects is that identifying multiple errors (such as during validation) is MUCH easier. After all, you can only throw one exception which must be handled before moving on. Imagine a user submitting an email that had a malformed destination address and contained language that you are blocking. Do you throw the malformed email exception, then, after they fix that and resubmit, throw a bad language exception? From a user experience perspective dealing with all of them at once is a better way to go. UPDATE: combining answers @Jonathan: My point was that I can evaluate the action, in this case sending an email, and send back multiple failure reasons. For example, \"bad email address\", \"blank message title\", etc.. With an exception, you're limited to just percolating the one problem then asking the user to resubmit at which point they find out about a second problem. This is really bad UI design. Reinventing the wheel.. possibly. However, most applications should analyze the whole transaction in order to give the best possible information to the user. Imagine if your compiler stopped dead at the first error. You then fix the error and hit compile again only to have it stop again for a different error. What a pain in the butt.

","pontos":12},{"corpo":"Yes! (except at the \"top\" of your application) By catching an exception and allowing the code execution to continue, you are stating that you know how do deal with and circumvent, or fix a particular problem. You are stating that this is a recoverable situation. Catching Exception or SystemException means that you will catch problems like IO errors, network errors, out-of-memory errors, missing-code errors, null-pointer-dereferencing and the likes. It is a lie to say that you can deal with these. In a well organised application, these unrecoverable problems should be handled high up the stack. In addition, as code evolves, you don't want your function to catch a new exception that is added in the future to a called method. ","pontos":8},{"corpo":"In my opinion you should catch all exceptions you expect, but this rule applies to anything but your interface logic. All the way down the call stack you should probably create a way to catch all exceptions, do some logging/give user feedback and, if needed and possible, shut down gracefully.

Not only does it give (perhaps unwanted) insight into your code, but it also confuses your end-user, and sometimes even scares them away to a competing application. ","pontos":5},{"corpo":"There are drawbacks of using reference counting. One of the most mentioned is circular references: Suppose A references B, B references C and C references B. If A were to drop its reference to B, both B and C will still have a reference count of 1 and won't be deleted with traditional reference counting. CPython (reference counting is not part of python itself, but part of the C implementation thereof) catches circular references with a separate garbage collection routine that it runs periodically... Another drawback: Reference counting can make execution slower. Each time an object is referenced and dereferenced, the interpreter/VM must check to see if the count has gone down to 0 (and then deallocate if it did). Garbage Collection does not need to do this. Also, Garbage Collection can be done in a separate thread (though it can be a bit tricky). On machines with lots of RAM and for processes that use memory only slowly, you might not want to be doing GC at all! Reference counting would be a bit of a drawback there in terms of performance...

","pontos":1},{"corpo":"The problem with catching all exceptions is that you may be catching ones that you don't expect, or indeed ones that you should not be catching. The fact is that an exception of any kind indicates that something has gone wrong, and you have to sort it out before continuing otherwise you may end up with data integrity problems and other bugs that are not so easy to track down. To give one example, in one project I implemented an exception type called CriticalException. This indicates an error condition that requires intervention by the developers and/or administrative staff otherwise customers get incorrectly billed, or other data integrity problems might result. It can also be used in other similar cases when merely logging the exception is not sufficient, and an e-mail alert needs to be sent out. Another developer who didn't properly understand the concept of exceptions then wrapped some code that could potentially throw this exception in a generic try...catch block which discarded all exceptions. Fortunately, I spotted it, but it could have resulted in serious problems, especially since the \"very uncommon\" corner case that it was supposed to catch turned out to be a lot more common than I anticipated. So in general, catching generic exceptions is bad unless you are 100% sure that you know exactly which kinds of exceptions will be thrown and under which circumstances. If in doubt, let them bubble up to the top level exception handler instead. A similar rule here is never throw exceptions of type System.Exception. You (or another developer) may want to catch your specific exception higher up the call stack while letting others go through. (There is one point to note, however. In .NET 2.0, if a thread encounters any uncaught exceptions it unloads your whole app domain. So you should wrap the main body of a thread in a generic try...catch block and pass any exceptions caught there to your global exception handling code.)

EDIT: Based on your additional information I think using the technique above, specifically resolving the references to an assembly yourself is the only real approach that is going to work without restructuring your app. What it gives you is that the location of each and every assembly that the CLR fails to resolve can be determined and loaded by your code at runtime...

Exceptions are preferable as they can be thrown up to the top of the service layer from anywhere inside the service layer, no matter how deeply nested inside the service method implementation it is. This keeps the service code clean as you know the calling presenter will always get notification of the problem. Don't catch Exception However, don't catch Exception in the presenter, I know its tempting because it keeps the code shorter, but you need to catch specific exceptions to avoid catching the system-level exceptions. Plan a Simple Exception Hierarchy If you are going to use exceptions in this way, you should design an exception hierarchy for your own exception classes. At a minumum create a ServiceLayerException class and throw one of these in your service methods when a problem occurs. Then if you need to throw an exception that should/could be handled differently by the presenter, you can throw a specific subclass of ServiceLayerException: say, AccountAlreadyExistsException. Your presenter then has the option of doing try { // call service etc. // handle success to view } catch (AccountAlreadyExistsException) { // set the message and some other unique data in the view } catch (ServiceLayerException) { // set the message in the view } // system exceptions, and unrecoverable exceptions are allowed to bubble // up the call stack so a general error can be shown to the user, rather // than showing the form again. Using inheritance in your own exception classes means you are not required to catch multipile exceptions in your presenter -- you can if there's a need to -- and you don't end up accidentally catching exceptions you can't handle. If your presenter is already at the top of the call stack, add a catch( Exception ) block to handle the system errors with a different view. I always try and think of my service layer as a seperate distributable library, and throw as specific an exception as makes sense. It is then up to the presenter/controller/remote-service implementation to decide if it needs to worry about the specific details or just to treat problems as a generic error.

Of course, I can use a different OpenID provider to log on with, but then I will have a different identity on the site. I guess you could say WordPress.com is to blame for this, but the problem reimains the same. By using OpenID you are depending on another site's service to function.

However, one big difference between the Java and Python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case (no circular references) objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date. For example, I can write sloppy, non-portable code in CPython such as def parse_some_attrs(fname): return open(fname).read().split(\"~~~\")[2:4] and the file descriptor for that file I opened will be cleaned up immediately because as soon as the reference to the open file goes away, the file is garbage collected and the file descriptor is freed. Of course, if I run Jython or IronPython or possibly PyPy, then the garbage collector won't necessarily run until much later; possibly I'll run out of file descriptors first and my program will crash. So you SHOULD be writing code that looks like def parse_some_attrs(fname): with open(fname) as f: return f.read().split(\"~~~\")[2:4] but sometimes people like to rely on reference counting to always free up their resources because it can sometimes make your code a little shorter.

I'll elaborate a bit: To synchronize the database structure, we have a single script, update.php, and a number of files numbered 1.sql, 2.sql, 3.sql, etc. The script uses one extra table to store the current version number of the database. The N.sql files are crafted by hand, to go from version (N-1) to version N of the database. They can be used to add tables, add columns, migrate data from an old to a new column format then drop the column, insert \"master\" data rows such as user types, etc. Basically, it can do anything, and with proper data migration scripts you'll never lose data. The update script works like this: Connect to the database. Make a backup of the current database (because stuff will go wrong) [mysqldump]. Create bookkeeping table (called _meta) if it doesn't exist. Read current VERSION from _meta table. Assume 0 if not found. For all .sql files numbered higher than VERSION, execute them in order If one of the files produced an error: roll back to the backup Otherwise, update the version in the bookkeeping table to the highest .sql file executed. Everything goes into source control, and every installation has a script to update to the latest version with a single script execution (calling update.php with the proper database password etc.). We SVN update staging and production environments via a script that automatically calls the database update script, so a code update comes with the necessary database updates. We can also use the same script to recreate the entire database from scratch; we just drop and recreate the database, then run the script which will completely repopulate the database. We can also use the script to populate an empty database for automated testing. It took only a few hours to set up this system, it's conceptually simple and everyone gets the version numbering scheme, and it has been invaluable in having the ability to move forward and evolving the database design, without having to communicate or manually execute the modifications on all databases. Beware when pasting queries from phpMyAdmin though! Those generated queries usually include the database name, which you definitely don't want since it will break your scripts! Something like CREATE TABLE .(...) will fail if the database on the system is not called mydb. We created a pre-comment SVN hook that will disallow .sql files containing the string, which is a sure sign that someone copy/pasted from phpMyAdmin without proper checking.

The concept behind TDD is you write the unit tests first, then write your code. If the test fails, you go back and re-work your code. If it passes, you move on to the next one. I take a hybrid approach to TDD. I don't like to write tests against nothing, so I usually write some of the code first, then put the unit tests in. It's an iterative process, one which you're never really done with. You change the code, you run your tests. If there's any failures, fix and repeat. The other sort of testing is integration testing, which comes along later in the process, and might typically be done by a QA testing team. In any case, integration testing addresses the need to test the pieces as a whole. It's the working product you're concerned with testing. This one is more difficult to deal with b/c it usually involves having automated testing tools (like Robot, for ex.). Also, take a look at a product like CruiseControl.NET to do continuous builds.

If I'm creating some new functionality for the system I'll be looking to initially define the interfaces and then write unit tests for those interfaces. To work out what tests to write consider the API of the interface and the functionality it provides, get out a pen and paper and think for a while about potential error conditions or ways to prove that it is doing the correct job. If this is too difficult then it's likely that your API isn't good enough. In regards to the tests, see if you can avoid writing \"integration\" tests that test more than one specific object and keep them as \"unit\" test. Then create a default implementation of your interface (that does nothing, returns rubbish values but doesn't throw exceptions), plug it into the tests to make sure that the tests fail (this tests that your tests work! :) ). Then write in the functionality and re-run the tests. This mechanism isn't perfect but will cover a lot of simple coding mistakes and provide you with an opportunity to run your new feature without having to plug it into the entire application. Following this you then need to test it in the main application with the combination of existing features. This is where testing is more difficult and if possible should be partially outsourced to good QA tester as they'll have the knack of breaking things. Although it helps if you have these skills too. Getting testing right is a knack that you have to pick up to be honest. My own experience comes from my own naive deployments and the subsequent bugs that were reported by the users when they used it in anger. At first when this happened to me I found it irritating that the user was intentionally trying to break my software and I wanted to mark all the \"bugs\" down as \"training issues\". However after reflecting on it I realised that it is our role (as developers) to make the application as simple and reliable to use as possible even by idiots. It is our role to empower idiots and thats why we get paid the dollar. Idiot handling. To effectively test like this you have to get into the mindset of trying to break everything. Assume the mantle of a user that bashes the buttons and generally attempts to destroy your application in weird and wonderful ways. Assume that if you don't find flaws then they will be discovered in production to your companies serious loss of face. Take full responsibility for all of these issues and curse yourself when a bug you are responsible (or even part responsible) for is discovered in production.

I think the problem here is that you are misunderstanding the fundamental value add of a code review. The point of code reviews is not specifically to find bugs. You should have other processes in place such as unit testing, integration testing, continuous integration builds, QA tools/teams, etc to find bugs. Code reviews provide value by identifying issues at different levels -- obviously you CAN identify specific bugs during code reviews, and that's great, but a code review can also help identify problems at a higher or lower level. For example, at a slightly higher level someone may be able to point out that there is a requirement that all currency must be stored as cents in integers rather than as dollars in floating point and that the code under review fails to meet that requirement (while otherwise being perfectly correct). At a a lower level, it gives more experienced developers an opportunity to give the more junior developers advice on how they could have solved problems better/more simply/etc. For example, perhaps the developer has a lot of nested for loops that could be replaced with some simple list comprehensions or higher order functions. Likewise it might also give a younger more energetic developer a chance to let an older more experienced, but also more set-in-his-ways developer know about some new cutting edge technology that would simplified their code drastically, etc. At the end of the day it also serves to just keep everyone up to date on what is going on in the code base, catch any egregious departures from what is expected, make sure everyone is on the right track, marching in the same direction, and to help the developers involved grow and evolve.

","pontos":1},{"corpo":"I'm tackling exactly this problem, and I had completely spaced iCalendar (rfc 2445) up until reading this thread, so I have no idea how well this will or won't integrate with that. Anyway the design I've come up with so far looks something like this: You can't possibly store all the instances of a recurring event, at least not before they occur, so I simply have one table that stores the first instance of the event as an actual date, an optional expiration, and nullable repeat_unit and repeat_increment fields to describe the repetition. For single instances the repition fields are null, otherwise the units will be 'day', 'week', 'month', 'year' and increment is simply the multiple of units to add to start date for the next occurrence. Storing past events only seems advantageous if you need to establish relationships with other entities in your model, and even then it's not necessary to have an explicit \"event instance\" table in every case. If the other entities already have date/time \"instance\" data then a foreign key to the event (or join table for a many-to-many) would most likely be sufficient. To do \"change this instance\"/\"change all future instances\", I was planning on just duplicating the events and expiring the stale ones. So to change a single instances, you'd expire the old one at it's last occurrence, make a copy for the new, unique occurrence with the changes and without any repetition, and another copy of the original at the following occurrence that repeats into the future. Changing all future instances is similar, you would just expire the original and make a new copy with the changes and repition details. The two problems I see with this design so far are: It makes MWF-type events hard to represent. It's possible, but forces the user to create three separate events that repeat weekly on M,W,F individually, and any changes they want to make will have to be done on each one separately as well. These kind of events aren't particularly useful in my app, but it does leave a wart on the model that makes it less universal than I'd like. By copying the events to make changes, you break the association between them, which could be useful in some scenarios (or, maybe it would just be occasionally problematic.) The event table could theoretically contain a \"copied_from\" id field to track where an event originated, but I haven't fully thought through how useful something like that would be. For one thing, parent/child hierarchical relationships are a pain to query from SQL, so the benefits would need to be pretty heavy to outweigh the cost for querying that data. You could use a nested-set instead, I suppose. Lastly I think it's possible to compute events for a given timespan using straight SQL, but I haven't worked out the exact details and I think the queries usually end up being too cumbersome to be worthwhile. However for the sake of argument, you can use the following expression to compute the difference in months between the given month and year an event: (:month + (:year * 12)) - (MONTH(occursOn) + (YEAR(occursOn) * 12)) Building on the last example, you could use MOD to determine whether difference in months is the correct multiple: MOD(:month + (:year * 12)) - (MONTH(occursOn) + (YEAR(occursOn) * 12), repeatIncrement) = 0 Anyway this isn't perfect (it doesn't ignore expired events, doesn't factor in start / end times for the event, etc), so it's only meant as a motivating example. Generally speaking though I think most queries will end up being too complicated. You're probably better off querying for events that occur during a given range, or don't expire before the range, and computing the instances themselves in code rather than SQL. If you really want the database to do the processing then a stored procedure would probably make your life a lot easier.

It is usually a common memory runtime trade-off. In the case of fibo, you don't even need to cache everything : [edit] The author of the question seems to be looking for a general method to cache rather than a method to compute Fibonacci. Search wikipedia or look at the code of the other poster to get this answer. Those answers are linear in time and memory. *Here is a linear-time algorithm O(n), constant in memory * in OCaml: let rec fibo n = let rec aux = fun | 0 - (1,1) | n - let (cur, prec) = aux (n-1) in (cur+prec, cur) let (cur,prec) = aux n in prec;; in C++: int fibo(int n) { if (n == 0 ) return 1; if (n == 1 ) return 1; int p = fibo(0); int c = fibo(1); int buff = 0; for (int i=1; i n; ++i) { buff = c; c = p+c; p = buff; }; return c; }; This perform in linear time. But log is actually possible !!! Roo's program is linear too, but way slower, and use memory. Here is the log algorithm O(log(n)) Now for the log-time algorithm (way way way faster), here is a method : If you know u(n), u(n-1), computing u(n+1), u(n) can be done by applying a matrix: | u(n+1) | = | 1 1 | | u(n) | | u(n) | | 1 0 | | u(n-1) | So that you have : | u(n) | = | 1 1 |^(n-1) | u(1) | = | 1 1 |^(n-1) | 1 | | u(n-1) | | 1 0 | | u(0) | | 1 0 | | 1 | Computing the exponential of the matrix has a logarithmic complexity. Just implement recursively the idea : M^(0) = Id M^(2p+1) = (M^2p) * M M^(2p) = (M^p) * (M^p) // of course don't compute M^p twice here. You can also just diagonalize it (not to difficult), you will find the gold number and its conjugate in its eigenvalue, and the result will give you an EXACT mathematical formula for u(n). It contains powers of those eigenvalues, so that the complexity will still be logarithmic. Fibo is often taken as an example to illustrate Dynamic Programming, but as you see, it is not really pertinent. @John: I don't think it has anything to do with do with hash. @John2: A map is a bit general don't you think?

Also be clear that Python 2.x has limited closure: there's no way I can modify 'x' inside 'bar' because writing 'x = bla' would declare a local 'x' in bar, not assign to 'x' of foo. This is a side-effect of Python's assignment=declaration. To get around this, Python 3.0 introduces the nonlocal keyword: def foo(): x = 3 def bar(): print x def ack(): nonlocal x x = 7 x = 5 return (bar, ack) bar, ack = foo() ack() # modify x of the call to foo bar() # print 7 ","pontos":11},{"corpo":"I used VisualSVN until Ankh hit 2.0, and ever since, I've abandoned VisualSVN.

Assignment is not an in-place operation, regardless of whether the argument is mutable or immutable. The parameter is a reference to a mutable list object, and the method performs an in-place extension of the list, tacking on the new string value.

Our experiences is that you can potentially get much better performance than typical relational databases. However, you really have to tweak your objects to get this kind of performance. For example, if you've got a list containing a lot of objects, DB4O activation of these lists is slow. There are a number of ways to get around this problem, for example, by inverting the relationship. Another pain is activation. When you retrieve or delete an object from DB4O, by default it will activate the whole object tree. For example, loading a Foo will load Foo.Bar.Baz.Bat, etc until there's nothing left to load. While this is nice from a programming standpoint, performance will slow down the more nesting in your objects. To improve performance, you can tell DB4O how many levels deep to activate. This is time-consuming to do if you've got a lot of objects. Another area of pain was text searching. DB4O's text searching is far, far slower than SQL full text indexing. (They'll tell you this outright on their site.) The good news is, it's easy to setup a text searching engine on top of DB4O. On our project, we've hooked up Lucene.NET to index the text fields we want. Some APIs don't seem to work, such as the GetField APIs useful in applying database upgrades. (For example, you've renamed a property and you want to upgrade your existing objects in the database, you need to use these \"reflection\" APIs to find objects in the database. Other APIs, such as the [Index] attribute don't work in the stable 6.4 version, and you must instead specify indexes using the Configure().Index(\"someField\"), which is not strongly typed. We've witnessed performance degrade the larger your database. We have a 1GB database right now and things are still fast, but not nearly as fast as when we started with a tiny database. We've found another issue where Db4O.GetByID will close the database if the ID doesn't exist anymore in the database. We've found the Native Query syntax (the most natural, language-integrated syntax for queries) is far, far slower than the less-friendly SODA queries. So instead of typing: // C# syntax for \"Find all MyFoos with Bar == 23\". // (Note the Java syntax is more verbose using the Predicate class.) IList MyFoo results = db4o.Query MyFoo (input = input.Bar == 23); Instead of that nice query code, you have to an ugly SODA query which is string-based and not strongly-typed. For .NET folks, they've recently introduced a LINQ-to-DB4O provider, which provides for the best syntax yet. However, it's yet to be seen whether performance will be up-to-par with the ugly SODA queries. DB4O support has been decent: we've talked to them on the phone a number of times and have received helpful info. Their user forums are next to worthless, however, almost all questions go unanswered. Their JIRA bug tracker receives a lot of attention, so if you've got a nagging bug, file it on JIRA on it often will get fixed. (We've had 2 bugs that have been fixed, and another one that got patched in a half-assed way.)

More to the point, it's simply unnecessary. Your application is highly unlikely to be modelling addresses in any serious way. If you want a postal address, ask for the postal address.

The exception to this is if you're doing something that's naturally constrained to one country anyway.

Can they happen, and are you handling them? (c) Does the data ever contain anything that might need to be encoded as an entity (like the less-than which often needs to be output as lt;); are you doing it correctly? Second, maintainability: is the code that builds the XML easy to understand by someone else? You probably don't want to be stuck with the code for life. I've worked with second-hand C++ code that hand-builds XML and it can be surprisingly obscure. Of course, if this is a personal project of yours, then you don't need to worry about \"others\": substitute \"in a year\" for \"others\" above. I wouldn't worry about performance. If your XML is simple enough that you can hand-write it, any overhead from the library is probably meaningless. Of course, your case might be different, but you should measure to prove it first. Finally, Yes; you can hand build XML text by hand if it's simple enough; but not knowing the libraries available is probably not the right reason. A modern XML library is a quite powerful tool, but it can also be daunting. However, learning the essentials of your XML library is not that hard, and it can be quite handy; among other things, it's almost a requisite in today's job marketplace. Just don't get bogged down by namespaces, schemas and other fancier features until you get the essentials. Good luck. ","pontos":11},{"corpo":"Which version of Delphi ? I just tried clean D7 application and TAggregateField was added. ","pontos":1},{"corpo":"There are two places where variables can be put in memory. When you create a variable like this: int a; char c; char d[16]; The variables are created in the \"stack\". Stack variables are automatically freed when they go out of scope (that is, when the code can't reach them anymore). You might hear them called \"automatic\" variables, but that has fallen out of fashion. Many beginner examples will use only stack variables. The stack is nice because it's automatic, but it also has two drawbacks: (1) The compiler needs to know in advance how big the variables are, and (b) the stack space is somewhat limited. For example: in Windows, under default settings for the Microsoft linker, the stack is set to 1 MB, and not all of it is available for your variables. If you don't know at compile time how big your array is, or if you need a big array or struct, you need \"plan B\". Plan B is called the \"heap\". You can usually create variables as big as the Operating System will let you, but you have to do it yourself. Earlier postings showed you one way you can do it, although there are other ways: int size; // ... // Set size to some value, based on information available at run-time. Then: // ... char *p = (char *)malloc(size); (Note that variables in the heap are not manipulated directly, but via pointers) Once you create a heap variable, the problem is that the compiler can't tell when you're done with it, so you lose the automatic releasing. That's where the \"manual releasing\" you were referring to comes in. Your code is now responsible to decide when the variable is not needed anymore, and release it so the memory can be taken for other purposes. For the case above, with: free(p); What makes this second option \"nasty business\" is that it's not always easy to know when the variable is not needed anymore. Forgetting to release a variable when you don't need it will cause your program to consume more memory that it needs to. This situation is called a \"leak\". The \"leaked\" memory cannot be used for anything until your program ends and the OS recovers all of its resources. Even nastier problems are possible if you release a heap variable by mistake before you are actually done with it. In C and C++, you are responsible to clean up your heap variables like shown above. However, there are languages and environments such as Java and .NET languages like C# that use a different approach, where the heap gets cleaned up on its own. This second method, called \"garbage collection\", is much easier on the developer but you pay a penalty in overhead and performance. It's a balance.

In every POSIX-like system (now you're running Windows, it seems, and that might have some quirk I don't know about, YMMV) each process has three streams, standard input, standard output and standard error. Bu default (when running in a console) these are directed to the console, but redirection is possible using the pipe notation: python script_a.py | python script_b.py This ties the standard output stream of script a to the standard input stream of script B. Standard error still goes to the console in this example. See the article on standard streams on Wikipedia. If you're talking about a child process, you can launch it from python like so (stdin is also an option if you want two way communication): import subprocess # Of course you can open things other than python here :) process = subprocess.Popen([\"python\", \"main.py\"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE) x = process.stderr.readline() y = process.stdout.readline() process.wait() See the Python subprocess module for information on managing the process. For communication, the process.stdin and process.stdout pipes are considered standard file objects. For use with pipes, reading from standard input as lassevk suggested you'd do something like this: import sys x = sys.stderr.readline() y = sys.stdin.readline() sys.stdin and sys.stdout are standard file objects as noted above, defined in the sys module. You might also want to take a look at the pipes module. Reading data with readline() as in my example is a pretty naïve way of getting data though.

Boxed values are typically stored as pointers to objects on the heap.

Obviously this isn't the kind of thing you want in your inner loops. On the other hand, boxed values typically play better with other types in the system. Since they are first-class data structures in the language, they have the expected metadata and structure that other data structures have. In Java and Haskell generic collections can't contain unboxed values. Generic collections in .NET can hold unboxed values with no penalties. Where Java's generics are only used for compile-time type checking, .NET will generate specific classes for each generic type instantiated at run time. Java and Haskell have unboxed arrays, but they're distinctly less convenient than the other collections. However, when peak performance is needed it's worth a little inconvenience to avoid the overhead of boxing and unboxing. * For this discussion, a primitive value is any that can be stored on the call stack, rather than stored as a pointer to a value on the heap. Frequently that's just the machine types (ints, floats, etc), structs, and sometimes static sized arrays. .NET-land calls them value types (as opposed to reference types).

If you need better precision you need to use a different number representation. Just like if you're doing integer math on numbers that don't fit in an int or long.

","pontos":3},{"corpo":"That's a really hard question. I've never implemented such thing but here's a simple aproximmation. Your main concern is due to hackers guessing what is it your application is doing and then sending their own results. Well, first of all, unless your application has a great success I wouldn't be worried. Doing such thing is extremely difficult. Encryption won't help with the problem. You see, encryption helps to protect the data on its way but it doesn't protect either of the sides of the transaction before the data is encrypted (which is where the main vulnerability may be). So if you encrypt the sure, the data will remain private but it won't be safe. If you are really worried about it I will suggest obfuscating the code and designing the score system in a way which is not completely obvious what is doing. Here we can borrow some things from an encryption protocol. Here is an example: Let's say the score is some number m Compute some kind of check over the score (for example the CRC or any other system you see feet. In fact, if you just invent one, no matter how lame is it it will work better) Obtain the private key of the user (D) from your remote server (over a secure connection obviously). You're the only one which know this key. Compute X=m^D mod n (n being the public module of your public/private key algorithm) (that is, encrypt it :P) As you see that's just obfuscation of another kind. You can go down that way as long as you want. For example you can lookup the nearest two prime numbers to X and use them to encrypt the CRC and send it also to the server so you'll have the CRC and the score separately and with different encryption schemes. If you use that in conjunction with obfuscation I'd say that would be difficult to hack. Nontheless even that could be reverse engingeered, it all depends on the interest and ability of the hacker but ... seriously, what kind of freak takes so much effort to change its results on a game?

The last time I tracked down a similar issue it turned out a 3rd party OSS libray we were using stored handles to unmanaged objects in static memory. The longer the service ran the more handles the service picked up which caused the process' CPU performance to nose-dive very quickly. The way to try and resolve this sort of issue to ensure your services store nothing in memory inbetween the timer invocations, although if your 3rd party libraries use static memory you might have to do something clever like create an app domain for the timer invocation and ditch the app doamin (and its static memory) once processing is complete. The other issue I've seen in similar circumstances was with the timer synchronization code being suspect, which in effect allowed more than one thread to be running the processing code at once. When we debugged the code we found the 1st thread was blocking the 2nd, and by the time the 2nd kicked off there was a 3rd being blocked. Over time the blocking was lasting longer and longer and the CPU usage was therefore heading to the top. The solution we used to fix the issue was to implement proper synchronization code so the timer only kicked off another thread if it wouldn't be blocked.

A padding scheme is usually applied because most cryptographic filters are not semantically secure and to prevent some forms of cryptoatacks. For example, usually in RSA the OAEP padding scheme is used which prevents some sorts of attacks (such as a chosen plaintext attack or blinding). A padding scheme appends some (usually) random garbage to the message m before the message is sent. In the OAEP method, for example, two Oracles are used (this is a simplistic explanation): Given the size of the modulus you padd k1 bits with 0 and k0 bits with a random number. Then by applying some transformation to the message you obtain the padded message wich is encrypted and sent. That provides you with a randomization for the messages and with a way to test if the message is garbage or not. As the padding scheme is reversible, when you decrypt the message whereas you can't say anything about the integrity of the message itself you can, in fact, make some assertion about the padding and thus you can know if the message has been correctly decrypted or you're doing something wrong (i.e someone has tampered with the message or you're using the wrong key) ","pontos":23},{"corpo":"Sounds like a threading issue with the timer.

Changing the positions of the ListObjects to place the wider one above the smaller one works fine. Following the logic above, this now means that the wider ListObject can shift all of the columns of the second ListObject, and since there is nothing below the smaller one it can also shift any cells necessary. The reason I wasn't having any trouble on the initial binding is that both ListObjects were a single cell.

As a few people have stated subsequently Dispose and implementing IDisposable has nothing to do with freeing the memory associated with a .NET class.

So it is possible that if you have cleared all references to the object it might still be a couple of calls to GC.Collect() before the actual memory is freed. You don't say in your question WHY you feel the need to free up memory immediately. I understand that sometimes there can be unusual circumstances but seriously, in managed code it is almost always best to let the runtime deal with memory management. Probably the best advice if you think your code is using up memory quicker than the GC is freeing it then you should review your code to ensure that no objects that are no longer needed are referenced in any data structures you have lying around in static members etc. Also try to avoid situations where you have circular object references as it is possible that these may not be freed either.

A lot of them have been mentioned, so I'll just stick with one specific point. Command-line tools are usually not interactive at all, while GUI's are. This is a fundamental difference. This is for example painful for long-running tasks. Your command-line tool will at best print out some kind of progress information - newlines, a textual progress bar, a bunch of output, ... Any kind of error it can only output to the console. Now you want to slap a GUI on top of that, what do you do ? Parse the output of your long-running command line tool ? Scan for WARNING and ERROR in that output to throw up a dialog box ? At best, most UI's built this way throw up a pulsating busy bar for as long as the command runs, then show you a success or failure dialog when the command exits. Sadly, this is how a lot of UNIX GUI programs are thrown together, making it a terrible user experience. Most repliers here are correct in saying that you should probably abstract the actual functionality of your program into a library, then write a command-line interface and the GUI at the same time for it. All your business logic should be in your library, and either UI (yes, a command line is a UI) should only do whatever is necessary to interface between your business logic and your UI. A command line is too poor a UI to make sure you develop your library good enough for GUI use later. You should start with both from the get-go, or start with the GUI programming. It's easy to add a command line interface to a library developed for a GUI, but it's a lot harder the other way around, precisely because of all the interactive features the GUI will need (reporting, progress, error dialogs, i18n, ...)

Last in, first out (LIFO) means that the last thing you put in is always the first thing you get back out - if you push 2 items on the stack, 'A' and then 'B', then the first thing you pop off the stack will be 'B', and the next thing is 'A'. When you call a function in your code, the next instruction after the function call is stored on the stack, and any storage space that might be overwritten by the function call. The function you call might use up more stack for its own local variables. When it's done, it frees up the local variable stack space it used, then returns to the previous function. Stack overflow A stack overflow is when you've used up more memory for the stack than your program was supposed to use. In embedded systems you might only have 256 bytes for the stack, and if each function takes up 32 bytes then you can only have function calls 8 deep - function 1 calls function 2 who calls function 3 who calls function 4 .... who calls function 8 who calls function 9, but function 9 overwrites memory outside the stack. This might overwrite memory, code, etc. Many programmers make this mistake by calling function A that then calls function B, that then calls function C, that then calls function A. It might work most of the time, but just once the wrong input will cause it to go in that circle forever until the computer recognizes that the stack is overblown. Recursive functions are also a cause for this, but if you're writing recursively (ie, your function calls itself) then you need to be aware of this and use static/global variables to prevent infinite recursion. Generally, the OS and the programming language you're using manage the stack, and it's out of your hands. You should look at your call graph (a tree structure that shows from your main what each function calls) to see how deep your function calls go, and to detect cycles and recursion that are not intended. Intentional cycles and recursion need to be artificially checked to error out if they call each other too many times. Beyond good programming practices, static and dynamic testing, there's not much you can do on these high level systems. Embedded systems In the embedded world, especially in high reliability code (automotive, aircraft, space) you do extensive code reviews and checking, but you also do the following: Disallow recursion and cycles - enforced by policy and testing Keep code and stack far apart (code in flash, stack in RAM, and never the twain shall meet) Place guard bands around the stack - empty area of memory that you fill with a magic number (usually a software interrupt instruction, but there are many options here), and hundreds or thousands of times a second you look at the guard bands to make sure they haven't been overwritten. Use memory protection (ie, no execute on the stack, no read or write just outside the stack) Interrupts don't call secondary functions - they set flags, copy data, and let the application take care of processing it (otherwise you might get 8 deep in your function call tree, have an interrupt, and then go out another few functions inside the interrupt, causing the blowout). You have several call trees - one for the main processes, and one for each interrupt. If your interrupts can interrupt each other... well, there be dragons... High-level languages and systems But in high level languages run on operating systems: Reduce your local variable storage (local variables are stored on the stack - although compilers are pretty smart about this and will sometimes put big locals on the heap if your call tree is shallow) Avoid or strictly limit recursion Don't break your programs up too far into smaller and smaller functions - even without counting local variables each function call consumes as much as 64 bytes on the stack (32 bit processor, saving half the CPU registers, flags, etc) Keep your call tree shallow (similar to the above statement) Web servers It depends on the 'sandbox' you have whether you can control or even see the stack. Chances are good you can treat web servers as you would any other high level language and operating system - it's largely out of your hands, but check the language and server stack you're using. It is possible to blow the stack on your SQL server, for instance.

If the friction of not sharing is lower than the friction of not sharing (which it is in DVCS), a developer, all else being equal, might easily choose the path of least friction.

But most projects using DVCS still have the concept of a 'master' branch at a 'central location' that they release from.

Really you need to know what oldFunction is going to be doing with pStuff.

Of course you will not be able to assign any managed objects to this pointer directly. Fundamentally unmanaged and managed pointers are not the same and can't be converted without some sort of glue code that copies the underlying data. Basically managed pointers point to the managed heap and since this is garbage collected the actual memory address they point to can change over time. Unmanaged pointers do not change the memory address without you explicitly doing so. Scratch that, you can't define unmanaged / managed inside a class definition. But this test code seems to work just fine: // TestSol.cpp : main project file. #include \"stdafx.h\" using namespace System; #pragma unmanaged void oldFunction(void** pStuff) { return; } #pragma managed ref class Test { public: void* m_test; }; int main(array System::String ^ ^args) { Console::WriteLine(L\"Hello World\"); Test^ test = gcnew Test(); void* pStuff = test- m_test; oldFunction( pStuff); test- m_test = pStuff; return 0; } Here I copy the pointer out of the managed object first and then pass that in by to the oldFunction.

Software can change rapidly from version to version, so before you go choosing a DBMS based on the advice below, do some research to see if it's still accurate. Better? MySQL is much more commonly provided by web hosts. PostgreSQL is a much more mature product. There's this discussion addressing your \"better\" question Apparently, according to this web page, MySQL is fast when concurrent access levels are low, and when there are many more reads than writes. On the other hand, it exhibits low scalability with increasing loads and write/read ratios. PostgreSQL is relatively slow at low concurrency levels, but scales well with increasing load levels, while providing enough isolation between concurrent accesses to avoid slowdowns at high write/read ratios. It goes on to link to a number of performance comparisons, because these things are very... sensitive to conditions. So if your decision factor is, \"which is faster?\" Then the answer is \"it depends. If it really matters, test your application against both.\" And if you really, really care, you get in two DBAs (one who specializes in each database) and get them to tune the crap out of the databases, and then choose. It's astonishing how expensive good DBAs are; and they are worth every cent. When it matters. Which it probably doesn't, so just pick whichever database you like the sound of and go with it; better performance can be bought with more RAM and CPU, and more appropriate database design, and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-X than agonizing over which to pick, MySQL or PostgreSQL, and specialist tuning from expensive DBAs.

It's possible to write a class that would compile fine but fail at runtime when you try to instantiate it: public class Something : ITest String { private Something() { } } Something derives from ITest T , but implements no parameterless constructor. It will compile fine, because String does implement a parameterless constructor. Again, the constraint is on T, and therefore String, rather than ITest or Something. Since the constraint on T is satisfied, this will compile. But it will fail at runtime. To prevent some instances of this problem, you need to add another constraint to T, as below: public interface ITest T where T : ITest T , new() { } Note the new constraint: T : ITest T . This constraint specifies that what you pass into the argument parameter of ITest T must also derive from ITest T . Even so this will not prevent all cases of the hole.

Do note that: My application is bandwidth hungry (starting at 100mbps per instance) My company and I are based in Switzerland and that surely has had an impact on our evaluation.

The following taken from the above link: const_cast const_cast(expression) The const_cast >() is used to add/remove const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable. static_cast static_cast(expression) The static_cast >() is used to cast between the integer types. 'e.g.' char->long, int->short etc. Static cast is also used to cast pointers to related types, for example casting void* to the appropriate type. dynamic_cast Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time, generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy). dynamic_cast(expression) The target type must be a pointer or reference type, and the expression must evaluate to a pointer or reference. Dynamic cast works only when the type of object to which the expression refers is compatible with the target type and the base class has at least one virtual member function. If not, and the type of expression being cast is a pointer, NULL is returned, if a dynamic cast on a reference fails, a bad_cast exception is thrown. When it doesn't fail, dynamic cast returns a pointer or reference of the target type to the object to which expression referred. reinterpret_cast Reinterpret cast simply casts one type bitwise to another. Any pointer or integral type can be casted to any other with reinterpret cast, easily allowing for misuse. For instance, with reinterpret cast one might, unsafely, cast an integer pointer to a string pointer. ","pontos":35},{"corpo":"Static Cast static_cast doesn't do any run time checking of the types involved, which means that unless you know what you are doing, they could be very unsafe. It also only allows casting between related types, such as pointers or references between Base and Derived, or between fundamental types, such as long to int or int to float. It does not allow casts between fundamentally different types, such as a cast between a BaseA and BaseB if they are not related. This will result in a compile time error. Dynamic Cast dynamic_cast will do run time checking as well, and if the instance cannot be cast into another derived type, it will return a null pointer. Note: dynamic cast works only when the source type is polymorphic.Otherwise, compiler will give an error such as * error: cannot dynamic_cast 'b' (of type 'class base*') to type 'class inh1*' (source type is not polymorphic)* Examples If we have the following classes class B {}; class D : B {}; then you can do the following B* b = new D(); D* d1 = static_cast D* b; // Valid! d1 is a valid and correct pointer to a D D* d2 = dynamic_cast D* b; // Valid! d2 is a valid and correct pointer to a D In this example both pointers d1 and d2 will point to a correct typed version of b The problem comes in the following example: B* b = new B(); D* d1 = static_cast D* b; // Invalid! D* d2 = dynamic_cast D* b; // Valid, but d2 is now a null pointer Now d1 will point to a data segment of type D*, but the actual data is B*, and will lead to memory issues and corruption. d2 on the other hand will be a null pointer and can be checked for and handled correctly.

Also, .GetType() will never return an abstract type/interface since you can't new up an abstract type or interface. GetType() returns concrete types only. The reason this doesn't work if(ctrl is typeToFind) Is because the type of the variable typeToFind is actually System.RuntimeType, not the type you've set its value to.

If you have to, use reference counting for objects that are long-lived and need to be shared between diverse parts of your code. Sometimes you need to allocate objects dynamically, but they will only be used within a certain span of time. For example, in a previous project I needed to create a complex in-memory representation of a database schema -- basically a complex cyclic graph of objects. However, the graph was only needed for the duration of a database connection, after which all the nodes could be freed in one shot. In this kind of scenario, a good pattern to use is something I call the \"local GC idiom.\" I'm not sure if it has an \"official\" name, as it's something I've only seen in my own code, and in Cocoa (see NSAutoreleasePool in Apple's Cocoa reference). In a nutshell, you create a \"collector\" object that keeps pointers to the temporary objects that you allocate using new. It is usually tied to some scope in your program, either a static scope (e.g. -- as a stack-allocated object that implements the RAII idiom) or a dynamic one (e.g. -- tied to the lifetime of a database connection, as in my previous project). When the \"collector\" object is freed, its destructor frees all of the objects that it points to. Also, like DrPizza I think the restriction to not use templates is too harsh. However, having done a lot of development on ancient versions of Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX (just recently - yes, these platforms are still alive in the Fortune 50), I can tell you that if you really care about portability, you should use templates as little as possible. Using them for containers and smart pointers ought to be ok, though (it worked for me). Without templates the technique I described is more painful to implement. It would require that all objects managed by the \"collector\" derive from a common base class.

If it's because enumerating the collection might be slow, then there is no solution that will be faster. You might want to consider using an ICollection instead if possible. Unless the enumeration is remarkably slow (e.g. it reads items from disk) speed shouldn't be a problem though. If it's because enumerating the collection will require more code then it's already been written for you in the form of the .Count() extension method. Just use MyEnumerable.Count(). If it's because you want to be able to enumerate the collection after you've counted then the .Count() extension method allows for this. You can even call .Count() on a collection you're in the middle of enumerating and it will carry on from where it was before the count. For example: foreach (int item in Series.Generate(5)) { Console.WriteLine(item + \"(\" + myEnumerable.Count() + \")\"); } will give the results 0 (5) 1 (5) 2 (5) 3 (5) 4 (5) If it's because the enumeration has side effects (e.g. writes to disk/console) or is dependant on variables that may change between counting and enumerating (e.g. reads from disk) [N.B. If possible, I would suggest rethinking the architecture as this can cause a lot of problems] then one possibility to consider is reading the enumeration into an intermittent storage. For example: List int seriesAsList = Series.Generate(5).ToList(); All of the above assume you can't change the type (i.e. it is returned from a library that you do not own). If possible you might want to consider changing to use an ICollection or IList (ICollection being more widely scoped than IList) which has a Count property on it.

I don't know the implementation details of the Stack Overflow authentication provider, but that cookie data is probably automatically used to verify your identity at a lower level than the \"vote\" controller method. More generally, cookies are not required for AJAX. XmlHttpRequest support (or even iframe remoting, on older browsers) is all that is technically required. However, if you want to provide security for AJAX enabled functionality, then the same rules apply as with traditional sites. You need some method for identifying the user behind each request, and cookies are almost always the means to that end. In your example, I cannot write to your document.cookie, but I can still steal your cookie and post it to my domain using the XMLHttpRequest object. XmlHttpRequest won't make cross-domain requests (for exactly the sorts of reasons you're touching on). You could normally inject script to send the cookie to your domain using iframe remoting or JSONP, but then HTTP-Only protects the cookie again since it's inaccessible. Unless you had compromised StackOverflow.com on the server side, you wouldn't be able to steal my cookie. Edit 2: Question 2. If the purpose of Http-Only is to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, and you can still retrieve the cookies via JavaScript through the XmlHttpRequest Object, what is the point of Http-Only? Consider this scenario: I find an avenue to inject JavaScript code into the page. Jeff loads the page and my malicious JavaScript modifies his cookie to match mine. Jeff submits a stellar answer to your question. Because he submits it with my cookie data instead of his, the answer will become mine. You vote up \"my\" stellar answer. My real account gets the point. With HTTP-Only cookies, the second step would be impossible, thereby defeating my XSS attempt. Edit 4: Sorry, I meant that you could send the XMLHttpRequest to the StackOverflow domain, and then save the result of getAllResponseHeaders() to a string, regex out the cookie, and then post that to an external domain. It appears that Wikipedia and ha.ckers concur with me on this one, but I would love be re-educated... That's correct. You can still session hijack that way. It does significantly thin the herd of people who can successfully execute even that XSS hack against you though. However, if you go back to my example scenario, you can see where HTTP-Only does successfully cut off the XSS attacks which rely on modifying the client's cookies (not uncommon). It boils down to the fact that a) no single improvement will solve all vulnerabilities and b) no system will ever be completely secure. HTTP-Only is a useful tool in shoring up against XSS. Similarly, even though the cross domain restriction on XmlHttpRequest isn't 100% successful in preventing all XSS exploits, you'd still never dream of removing the restriction.

","pontos":3},{"corpo":"The hard way You want a recursive descent parser. To get precedence you need to think recursively, for example, using your sample string, 1+11*5 to do this manually, you would have to read the , then see the plus and start a whole new recursive parse \"session\" starting with ... and make sure to parse the into its own factor, yielding a parse tree with . This all feels so painful even to attempt to explain, especially with the added powerlessness of C. See, after parsing the 11, if the * was actually a + instead, you would have to abandon the attempt at making a term and instead parse the itself as a factor. My head is already exploding. It's possible with the recursive decent strategy, but there is a better way... The easy (right) way If you use a GPL tool like Bison, you probably don't need to worry about licensing issues since the C code generated by bison is not covered by the GPL (IANAL but I'm pretty sure GPL tools don't force the GPL on generated code/binaries; for example Apple compiles code like say, Aperture with GCC and they sell it without having to GPL said code). Download Bison (or something equivalent, ANTLR, etc.). There is usually some sample code that you can just run bison on and get your desired C code that demonstrates this four function calculator: http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_mono/bison.html#Infix-Calc Look at the generated code, and see that this is not as easy as it sounds. Also, the advantages of using a tool like Bison are 1) you learn something (especially if you read the Dragon book and learn about grammars), 2) you avoid NIH trying to reinvent the wheel. With a real parser-generator tool, you actually have a hope at scaling up later, showing other people you know that parsers are the domain of parsing tools. Update: People here have offered much sound advice. My only warning against skipping the parsing tools or just using the Shunting Yard algorithm or a hand rolled recursive decent parser is that little toy languages1 may someday turn into big actual languages with functions (sin, cos, log) and variables, conditions and for loops. Flex/Bison may very well be overkill for a small, simple interpreter, but a one off parser+evaluator may cause trouble down the line when changes need to be made or features need to be added. Your situation will vary and you will need to use your judgement; just don't punish other people for your sins [2] and build a less than adequate tool. My favorite tool for parsing The best tool in the world for the job is the Parsec library (for recursive decent parsers) which comes with the programming language Haskell. It looks a lot like BNF, or like some specialized tool or domain specific language for parsing (sample code [3]), but it is in fact just a regular library in Haskell, meaning that it compiles in the same build step as the rest of your Haskell code, and you can write arbitrary Haskell code and call that within your parser, and you can mix and match other libraries all in the same code. (Embedding a parsing language like this in a language other than Haskell results in loads of syntactic cruft, by the way. I did this in C# and it works quite well but it is not so pretty and succinct.) Notes: 1 Richard Stallman says, in Why you should not use Tcl The principal lesson of Emacs is that a language for extensions should not be a mere \"extension language\". It should be a real programming language, designed for writing and maintaining substantial programs. Because people will want to do that! [2] Yes, I am forever scarred from using that \"language\". Also note that when I submitted this entry, the preview was correct, but SO's less than adequate parser ate my close anchor tag on the first paragraph, proving that parsers are not something to be trifled with because if you use regexes and one off hacks you will probably get something subtle and small wrong.

Translating into C, this means: a[i] = (iH 4) OR iL a[i] = ((a[i+1] 0x0f) 4) | ((a[i+2] 0xf0) 4) We now make three more observations: since we carry out the assignments left to right, we don't need to store any values in temporary variables. we will have a special case for the tail: all 12 bits at the end will be zero. we must avoid reading undefined memory past the array. since we never read more than a[i+2], this only affects the last two bytes So, we - handle the general case by looping for N-2 bytes and performing the general calculation above - handle the next to last byte by it by setting iH = (i+1)L - handle the last byte by setting it to 0 given a with length N, we get: for (i = 0; i N - 2; ++i) { a[i] = ((a[i+1] 0x0f) 4) | ((a[i+2] 0xf0) 4); } a[N-2] = (a[N-1) 0x0f) 4; a[N-1] = 0; And there you have it... the array is shifted left by 12 bits. It could easily be generalized to shifting N bits, noting that there will be M assignment statements where M = number of bits modulo 8, I believe. The loop could be made more efficient on some machines by translating to pointers for (p = a, p2=a+N-2; p != p2; ++p) { *p = ((*(p+1) 0x0f) 4) | (((*(p+2) 0xf0) 4); } and by using the largest integer data type supported by the CPU.

It could take quite a long time before the Memory Management system (i.e., the garbage collector) decides to collect an object with a finalizer. Many people use finalizers to do things like close socket connections or delete temporary files. By doing so you make your application behaviour unpredictable and tied to when the JVM is going to GC your object. This can lead to \"out of memory\" scenarios, not due to the Java Heap being exhausted, but rather due to the system running out of handles for a particular resource. One other thing to keep in mind is that introducing the calls to System.gc() or such hammers may show good results in your environment, but they won't necessarily translate to other systems. Not everyone runs the same JVM, there are many, SUN, IBM J9, BEA JRockit, Harmony, OpenJDK, etc... This JVM all conform to the JCK (those that have been officially tested that is), but have a lot of freedom when it comes to making things fast.

That result is typically defined by you ahead of time.

But that's not a good algorithm, since it requires lots of division. You should also be able to parallelize the sieve algorithms, if you have writer work packets which are guaranteed to complete before a read. Mostly the writers shouldn't conflict with the reader - at least once you've done a few entries, they should be working at least N above the reader, so you only need a synchronized read fairly occasionally (when N exceeds the last synchronized read value). You shouldn't need to synchronize the bool array across any number of writer threads, since write conflicts don't arise (at worst, more than one thread will write a true to the same place). The main issue would be to ensure that any worker being waited on to write has completed. In C++ you'd use a compare-and-set to switch to the worker which is being waited for at any point. I'm not a C# wonk so don't know how to do it that language, but the Win32 InterlockedCompareExchange function should be available. You also might try an actor based approach, since that way you can schedule the actors working with the lowest values, which may be easier to guarantee that you're reading valid parts of the the sieve without having to lock the bus on each increment of N.

This is a good approach, and the one I would recommend if you are starting from scratch. If you have a lot of code using, e.g., badges as strings, then rewriting code may make this a non-viable option. Add an enumeration to the method, specifying how to treat the string. This works, but requires that you rewrite all the existing calls to include the new enumeration (though you can provide a default if desired to avoid some of this). Add a dummy parameter that is unused to distinguish between the two overloads. e.g. Tack a onto the method. This approach is taken by the standard library in a few places, e.g. is a dummy parameter for . The disadvantages of this approach are that it's ugly and that it doesn't scale. If you already have a large base of existing code, I'd recommend either adding the enumeration (possibly with a default value) or adding the dummy parameter. Neither is beautiful, but both are fairly simple to retrofit. If you are starting from scratch, or only have a small amount of code, I'd recommend the custom object wrappers.

I'm not sure that the distinction is artificial. After a dynamic load the plugin code shares an execution context with the GPLed code. After a fork/exec it does not. In anycase I would guess that ing causes the new code to run in the same execution context as the GPLed bit, and you should treat it like the dynamic link case. No? ","pontos":1},{"corpo":" he distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking, besides being kind of artificial, I don't think its artificial at all. Basically they are just making the division based upon the level of integration. If the program has \"plugins\" which are essentially fire and forget with no API level integration, then the resulting work is unlikely to be considered a derived work. Generally speaking a plugin which is merely forked/exec'ed would fit this criteria, though there may be cases where it does not. This case especially applies if the \"plugin\" code would work independently of your code as well. If, on the other hand, the code is deeply dependent upon the GPL'ed work, such as extensively calling APIs, or tight data structure integration, then things are more likely to be considered a derived work. Ie, the \"plugin\" cannot exist on its own without the GPL product, and a product with this plugin installed is essentially a derived work of the GPLed product. So to make it a little more clear, the same principles could apply to your interpreted code. If the interpreted code relies heavily upon your APIs (or vice-versa) then it would be considered a derived work. If it is just a script that executes on its own with extremely little integration, then it may not. Does that make more sense?

I do a production release roughly every 2 to 3 weeks, with 50-100 items cleared from my FogBugz list for each one. Every release we've done over the last few years has required schema changes to support new features. The key to this is to practice the changes several times in a test environment before actually making them on the live servers. I keep a deployment checklist file that is copied from a template and then heavily edited for each release with anything that is out of the ordinary. I have two scripts that I run on the database, one for schema changes, one for programmability (procedures, views, etc). The changes script is coded by hand, and the one with the procs is scripted via Powershell. The change script is run when everything is turned off (you have to pick a time that annoys the least amount of users for this), and it is run command by command, manually, just in case anything goes weird. The most common problem I have run into is adding a unique constraint that fails due to duplicate rows. When preparing for an integration testing cycle, I go through my checklist on a test server, as if that server was production.

Templates are one of the main reasons why C++ fails so abysmally at intellisense, regardless of the IDE used. Because of template specialization, the IDE can never be really sure if a given member exists or not. Consider: template typename T struct X { void foo() { } }; template struct X int { }; typedef int my_int_type; X my_int_type a; a.| Now, the cursor is at the indicated position and it's damn hard for the IDE to say at that point if, and what, members has. For other languages the parsing would be straightforward but for C++, quite a bit of evaluation is needed beforehand. It gets worse. What if were defined inside a class template as well? Now its type would depend on another type argument. And here, even compilers fail. template typename T struct Y { typedef T my_type; }; X Y int ::my_type b; After a bit of thinking, a programmer would conclude that this code is the same as the above: resolves to , therefore should be the same type as , right? Wrong. At the point where the compiler tries to resolve this statement, it doesn't actually know yet! Therefore, it doesn't know that this is a type. It could be something else, e.g. a member function or a field. This might give rise to ambiguities (though not in the present case), therefore the compiler fails. We have to tell it explicitly that we refer to a type name: X typename Y int ::my_type b; Now, the code compiles. To see how ambiguities arise from this situation, consider the following code: Y int ::my_type(123); This code statement is perfectly valid and tells C++ to execute the function call to . However, if is not a function but rather a type, this statement would still be valid and perform a special cast (the function-style cast) which is often a constructor invocation.

They definitely use pool threads rather than a thread-per-timer, though. The standard way to implement a big collection of timers (which is how the kernel does it internally, and I would suspect is indirectly how your big collection of Timers ends up) is to maintain the list sorted by time-until-expiry - so the system only ever has to worry about checking the next timer which is going to expire, not the whole list. Roughly, this gives O(log n) for starting a timer and O(1) for processing running timers. Edit: Just been looking in Jeff Richter's book. He says (of Threading.Timer) that it uses a single thread for all Timer objects, this thread knows when the next timer (i.e. as above) is due and calls ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem for the callbacks as appropriate. This has the effect that if you don't finish servicing one callback on a timer before the next is due, that your callback will reenter on another pool thread. So in summary I doubt you'll see a big problem with having lots of timers, but you might suffer thread pool exhaustion if large numbers of them are firing at the same timer and/or their callbacks are slow-running.

List Person foo = new List Person (); and then the compiler will prevent you from putting things that aren't into the list. Behind the scenes the C# compiler is just putting into the .NET dll file, but at runtime the JIT compiler goes and builds a new set of code, as if you had written a special list class just for containing people - something like . The benefit of this is that it makes it really fast. There's no casting or any other stuff, and because the dll contains the information that this is a List of , other code that looks at it later on using reflection can tell that it contains objects (so you get intellisense and so on). The downside of this is that old C# 1.0 and 1.1 code (before they added generics) doesn't understand these new , so you have to manually convert things back to plain old to interoperate with them. This is not that big of a problem, because C# 2.0 binary code is not backwards compatible. The only time this will ever happen is if you're upgrading some old C# 1.0/1.1 code to C# 2.0 Java Generics allow you to declare something like this. ArrayList Person foo = new ArrayList Person (); On the surface it looks the same, and it sort-of is. The compiler will also prevent you from putting things that aren't into the list. The difference is what happens behind the scenes. Unlike C#, Java does not go and build a special - it just uses the plain old which has always been in Java. When you get things out of the array, the usual casting-dance still has to be done. The compiler is saving you the key-presses, but the speed hit/casting is still incurred just like it always was. When people mention \"Type Erasure\" this is what they're talking about. The compiler inserts the casts for you, and then 'erases' the fact that it's meant to be a list of not just The benefit of this approach is that old code which doesn't understand generics doesn't have to care. It's still dealing with the same old as it always has. This is more important in the java world because they wanted to support compiling code using Java 5 with generics, and having it run on old 1.4 or previous JVM's, which microsoft deliberately decided not to bother with. The downside is the speed hit I mentioned previously, and also because there is no pseudo-class or anything like that going into the .class files, code that looks at it later on (with reflection, or if you pull it out of another collection where it's been converted into or so on) can't tell in any way that it's meant to be a list containing only and not just any other array list. C++ Templates allow you to declare something like this std::list Person * foo = new std::list Person (); It looks like C# and Java generics, and it will do what you think it should do, but behind the scenes different things are happening. It has the most in common with C# generics in that it builds special rather than just throwing the type information away like java does, but it's a whole different kettle of fish. Both C# and Java produce output which is designed for virtual machines. If you write some code which has a class in it, in both cases some information about a class will go into the .dll or .class file, and the JVM/CLR will do stuff with this. C++ produces raw x86 binary code. Everything is not an object, and there's no underlying virtual machine which needs to know about a class. There's no boxing or unboxing, and functions don't have to belong to classes, or indeed anything. Because of this, the C++ compiler places no restrictions on what you can do with templates - basically any code you could write manually, you can get templates to write for you. The most obvious example is adding things: In C# and Java, the generics system needs to know what methods are available for a class, and it needs to pass this down to the virtual machine. The only way to tell it this is by either hard-coding the actual class in, or using interfaces. For example: string addNames T ( T first, T second ) { return first.Name() + second.Name(); } That code won't compile in C# or Java, because it doesn't know that the type actually provides a method called Name(). You have to tell it - in C# like this: interface IHasName{ string Name(); }; string addNames T ( T first, T second ) where T : IHasName { .... } And then you have to make sure the things you pass to addNames implement the IHasName interface and so on. The java syntax is different (), but it suffers from the same problems. The 'classic' case for this problem is trying to write a function which does this string addNames T ( T first, T second ) { return first + second; } You can't actually write this code because there are no ways to declare an interface with the method in it. You fail. C++ suffers from none of these problems. The compiler doesn't care about passing types down to any VM's - if both your objects have a .Name() function, it will compile. If they don't, it won't. Simple.

Here are a couple more examples of invalid subscripts on valid expressions: $x = array(1,2,3); print ($x)[1]; //illegal, on a parenthetical expression, not a variable exp. function ret($foo) { return $foo; } echo ret($x)[1]; // illegal, on a call expression, not a variable exp.

Having to restart and run a debug build can be very inconvenient. Second: You may find assertions are more what you need. An assertion is a statement which evaluates to a boolean result, with an optional message: assert (sky.state != FALLING) : \"The sky is falling!\"; Whenever the assertion results in a false, the assertion fails and an AssertionError is thrown containing your message (this is an unchecked exception, intended to exit the application).

A C# implementation of the above described algorithm is as follows (complete console program with test harness):- using System; class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { var caseAlgorithm = new CaseAlgorithm('_'); while (true) { string input = Console.ReadLine(); if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(input)) return; Console.WriteLine(\"Input '{0}' in camel case: '{1}', pascal case: '{2}'\", input, caseAlgorithm.SetPhraseCase(input, CaseAlgorithm.CaseMode.CamelCase), caseAlgorithm.SetPhraseCase(input, CaseAlgorithm.CaseMode.PascalCase)); } } } public class CaseAlgorithm { public enum CaseMode { PascalCase, CamelCase } private char delimiterChar; public CaseAlgorithm(char inDelimiterChar) { delimiterChar = inDelimiterChar; } public string SetPhraseCase(string phrase, CaseMode caseMode) { // You might want to do some sanity checks here like making sure // there's no invalid characters, etc. if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(phrase)) return phrase; // .Split() will simply return a string[] of size 1 if no delimiter present so // no need to explicitly check this. var words = phrase.Split(delimiterChar); // Set first word accordingly. string ret = setWordCase(words[0], caseMode); // If there are other words, set them all to pascal case. if (words.Length 1) { for (int i = 1; i words.Length; ++i) ret += setWordCase(words[i], CaseMode.PascalCase); } return ret; } private string setWordCase(string word, CaseMode caseMode) { switch (caseMode) { case CaseMode.CamelCase: return lowerFirstLetter(word); case CaseMode.PascalCase: return capitaliseFirstLetter(word); default: throw new NotImplementedException( string.Format(\"Case mode '{0}' is not recognised.\", caseMode.ToString())); } } private string lowerFirstLetter(string word) { return char.ToLower(word[0]) + word.Substring(1); } private string capitaliseFirstLetter(string word) { return char.ToUpper(word[0]) + word.Substring(1); } } ","pontos":3},{"corpo":" It is inconsequential, that is true.

The real issue I think is that the C++ library has three parts; it has the old C library, it has the STL, and it has strings-and-iostreams. Though some efforts were made to bridge the different parts (e.g. the addition of overloads to the C library, because C++ supports overloading; the addition of iterators to basic_string; the addition of the iostream iterator adaptors), there are a lot of inconsistencies when you look at the detail. For example, basic_string includes methods that are unnecessary duplicates of standard algorithms; the various find methods, could probably be safely removed.

In other words, since your client can send email via SMTP, and it can use DNS to get the the MX record for hotmail.com, why doesn't it just send it there directly, skipping gmail.com altogether? There are a couple of reasons, some historical and some for security. In the original question, it was assumed that your Thunderbird client logs in with a user name and password. This is often not the case. SMTP doesn't actually require a login to send a mail. And SMTP has no way to tell who's really sending the mail. Thus, spam was born! There are, unfortunately, still many SMTP servers out there that allow anyone and everyone to connect and send mail, trusting blindly that the sender is who they claim to be. These servers are called \"open relays\" and are routinely black-listed by smarter administrators of other mail servers, because of the spam they churn out. Responsible SMTP server admins set up their server to accept mail for delivery only in special cases 1) the mail is coming from \"its own\" network, or 2) the mail is being sent to \"its own\" network, or 3) the user presents credentials that identifies him as a trusted sender. Case #1 is probably what happens when you send mail from work; your machine is on the trusted network, so you can send mail to anyone. A lot of corporate mail servers still don't require authentication, so you can impersonate anyone in your office. Fun! Case #2 is when someone sends you mail. And case #3 is probably what happens with your GMail example. You're not coming from a trusted network, your just out on the Internet with the spammers. But by using a password, you can prove to GMail that you are who you say you are. The historical aspect is that in the old days, the link between gmail and hotmail was likely to be intermittent.

This was resolved with the SP1 of the .NET Framework. The source of the problem is that UpdatePanel can detect markup changes in your page, but it has no way to track scripts correctly. Validators rely heavily on scripts. During a partial postback, the scripts are either blown away, not updated, or not run when they are meant to. In early betas, MS had the UpdatePanel try to guess what scripts needed to be re-rendered or run. It didn't work very well, and they had to take it out. To get around the immediate problem, Microsoft released a patched version of the validator classes in a new DLL called Validators.DLL, and gave instructions on how to tell ASP.NET to use those classes instead of the real ones. If you Google for that DLL name, you should find more information. See also This blog post. This was a stop-gag measure and you should not use it avoid it if possible. The real solution to the problem came shortly after, in .NET 2.0 SP1. Microsoft introduced a new mechanism to register scripts in SP1, and changed the real validator classes to use that mechanism instead of the older one. Let me give you some details on the changes: Traditionally, you were supposed to register scripts via Page methods such as Page.RegisterStartupScript() and Page.RegisterClientScriptBlock(). The problem is that these methods were not designed for extensibility and UpdatePanel had no way to monitor those calls. In SP1 there is a new property object on the page called Page.ClientScripts. This object has methods to register scripts that are equivalent (and in some ways better) to the original ones. Also, UpdatePanel can monitor these calls, so that it rerenders or calls the methods when appropriate. The older RegisterStartupScript(), etc. methods have been deprecated. They still work, but not inside an UpdatePanel. There is no reason (other than politics, I suppose) to not update your installations to .NET 2.0 SP1. Service Packs carry important fixes. Good luck.

After digging some more, and experimenting, I have found that you can add an Import directive into your .csproj file. When you do this, the IDE pops up a warning dialog that there is an unsafe entry point in your project - but you can ignore this, and you can make it not appear at all by editing a registry entry, evidently. So this would give me a way to get the variables containing the directory paths I need into the .csproj file.

Stuff like this is hard to do for a reason. It is possible to do, but it's a lot of work: you need to acquire the window handle of the thing you want to drop something onto, and then replace that window's message handler with your own.

Thus you would store an internal value indicating whether the value is true or false or null, i.e. in your example >0 for true, 0 for false and ==0 for null, and then you'd get SQL-style null semantics. You would also have to implement a .IsNull method or property in order that nullity could be checked explicitly. Comparing to SQL, imagine a table Table with 3 rows with value Foo set to true, 3 rows with value Foo set to false and 3 rows with value Foo set to null. SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table WHERE Foo = TRUE OR Foo = FALSE 6 In order to count all rows you'd have to do the following:- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table WHERE Foo = TRUE OR Foo = FALSE OR Foo IS NULL 9 This 'IS NULL' syntax would have equivilent code in your class as .IsNull(). LINQ makes the comparison to C# even clearer:- int totalCount = (from s in MyTypeEnumerable where s || !s select s).Count(); Imagining that MyTypeEnumberable has exactly the same contents of the database, i.e. 3 values equal to true, 3 values equal to false and 3 values equal to null. In this case totalCount would evaluate to 6 in this case. However, if we re-wrote the code as:- int totalCount = (from s in MyTypeEnumerable where s || !s || s.IsNull() select s).Count(); Then totalCount would evaluate to 9. The DBNull example given in the linked MSDN article on the false operator demonstrates a class in the BCL which has this exact behaviour. In effect the conclusion is you shouldn't use this unless you're completely sure you want this type of behaviour, it's better to just use the far simpler nullable syntax!! Update: I just noticed you need to manually override the logic operators !, || and to make this work properly.

The restrictions are that you dont want to do RTTID, and dont want to write code to handle every possible type of concrete parameter. You are open to using the visitor pattern. With those being your requirements, here is how I would handle such a situation: I would implement the visitor pattern where the accept() returns a boolean value. The base Parameter class would implement a virtual accept() function and return false. Concrete implementations of the Parameter class would then contain accept() functions which will call the visitor's visit(). They would return true. The visitor class would make use of a templated visit() function so you would only override for the concrete Parameter types you care to support: class Visitor { public: template class T void visit( const T param ) const { assert( false \"this parameter type not specialised in the visitor\" ); } void visit( const ParameterLimitedInt ) const; // specialised implementations... } Thus if accept() returns false, you know the concrete type for the Parameter has not implemented the visitor pattern yet (in case there is additional logic you would prefer to handle on a case by case basis). If the assert() in the visitor pattern triggers, its because its not visiting a Parameter type which you've implemented a specialisation for.

In order to improve the vertical alignment of a side-by-side diff, you can insert invisible HTML elements in each version of the diff at \"checkpoints\" where the diff should be vertically aligned. Then you can use a bit of client-side JavaScript to add vertical spacing around checkpoint until the sides line up vertically. Explained in a little more detail: If you want to use this technique, run your diff algorithm and insert a bunch of s or tiny s wherever your side-by-side versions should match up, according to the diff. Then run JavaScript that finds each checkpoint (and its side-by-side neighbor) and adds vertical spacing to the checkpoint that is higher-up (shallower) on the page. Now your rendered HTML diff will be vertically aligned up to that checkpoint, and you can continue repairing vertical alignment down the rest of your side-by-side page.

More precisely, it is an implementation of the Morphic GUI framework from Squeak Smalltalk in JavaScript using SVG and a port of (parts of) Squeak Smalltalk in JavaScript. Or, if you're not a Smalltalker and the above doesn't make sense to you: it's an Operating System, written in JavaScript with the JavaScript interpreter as the CPU, SVG as the graphics card and the browser as the computer. This is about as extreme as it gets, when it comes to JavaScript and SVG. And it only fully works in Safari 3 and partly in Firefox 3, although there is an experimental port to Internet Explorer as well. The second project is John Resig's Processing.js port of the Processing visualization language to JavaScript. It uses the element instead of SVG precisely because of the problems that you mentioned.

As was already explained, the main difference is type erasure, i.e. the fact that the Java compiler erases the generic types and they don't end up in the generated bytecode. However, the question is: why would anyone do that? It doesn't make sense! Or does it? Well, what's the alternative? If you don't implement generics in the language, where do you implement them? And the answer is: in the Virtual Machine. Which breaks backwards compatibility. Type erasure, on the other hand, allows you to mix generic clients with non-generic libraries. In other words: code that was compiled on Java 5 can still be deployed to Java 1.4. Microsoft, however, decided to break backwards compatibility for generics. That's why .NET Generics are \"better\" than Java Generics. Of course, Sun aren't idiots or cowards. The reason why they \"chickened out\", was that Java was significantly older and more widespread than .NET when they introduced generics. (They were introduced roughly at the same time in both worlds.) Breaking backwards compatibility would have been a huge pain. Put yet another way: in Java, Generics are a part of the Language (which means they apply only to Java, not to other languages), in .NET they are part of the Virtual Machine (which means they apply to all languages, not just C# and Visual Basic.NET). Compare this with .NET features like LINQ, lambda expressions, local variable type inference, anonymous types and expression trees: these are all language features. That's why there are subtle differences between VB.NET and C#: if those features were part of the VM, they would be the same in all languages. But the CLR hasn't changed: it's still the same in .NET 3.5 SP1 as it was in .NET 2.0. You can compile a C# program that uses LINQ with the .NET 3.5 compiler and still run it on .NET 2.0, provided that you don't use any .NET 3.5 libraries.

","pontos":8},{"corpo":"Instead of explaining it with words, here's an example. This is a Scheme version of the factorial function: (define (factorial x) (if (= x 0) 1 (* x (factorial (- x 1))))) Here is a version of factorial that is tail-recursive: (define factorial (letrec ((fact (lambda (x accum) (if (= x 0) accum (fact (- x 1) (* accum x)))))) (lambda (x) (fact x 1)))) You will notice in the first version that the recursive call to fact is fed into the multiplication expression, and therefore the state has to be saved on the stack when making the recursive call. In the tail-recursive version there is no other S-expression waiting for the value of the recursive call, and since there is no further work to do, the state doesn't have to be saved on the stack. As a rule, Scheme tail-recursive functions use constant stack space. ","pontos":43},{"corpo":"did you try... ??

I really like it; while Django's generic views allow some customization through keyword arguments, OO generic views (if their behavior is split into a number of separate methods) can have much more fine-grained customization via subclassing, which lets me repeat myself a lot less. (I get tired of rewriting the same create/update view logic anytime I need to tweak something Django's generic views don't quite allow). I've posted some code at djangosnippets.org.

I don't think this is much of a concern; it's rare that Python code execution would be your performance bottleneck in a web app. UPDATE: Django's own generic views are now class-based. UPDATE: FWIW, I've changed my opinion on class-based views since this answer was written. After having used them extensively on a couple of projects, I feel they tend to lead to code that is satisfyingly DRY to write, but very hard to read and maintain later, because functionality is spread across so many different places, and subclasses are so dependent on every implementation detail of the superclasses and mixins.

For example: int one = 1; int two = 2; // bitwise xor if (one ^ two) { // executes because expression = 3 and any non-zero integer evaluates to true } // logical xor; more correctly would be coded as // if (bool(one) != bool(two)) // but spelled out to be explicit in the context of the problem if ((one !two) || (!one two)) { // does not execute b/c expression = ((true false) || (false true)) // which evaluates to false } Credit to user @Patrick for expressing this first. Order of operations Second, , , and , as bitwise operators, do not short-circuit. In addition, multiple bitwise operators chained together in a single statement -- even with explicit parentheses -- can be reordered by optimizing compilers, because all 3 operations are normally commutative. This is important if the order of the operations matters. In other words bool result = true; result = result a() b(); // will not call a() if result false, will not call b() if result or a() false will not always give the same result (or end state) as bool result = true; result = (a() b()); // a() and b() both will be called, but not necessarily in that order in an // optimizing compiler This is especially important because you may not control methods and , or somebody else may come along and change them later not understanding the dependency, and cause a nasty (and often release-build only) bug.

This - along with checked arithmetic - provides one more net for developers, catching subtle bugs earlier. Another point in the signed vs unsigned debate is that some programmers use values such as -1 to indicate errors, when they wouldn't otherwise have meaning.

This means that if two threads are crunching numbers, only one can run at any given moment. It also means that you can't take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor architectures.

The solution is to flush the buffer after each debug print (or turn off the buffering altogether). (2) Be careful with initializations - (a) avoid class instances as globals / statics; and (b) try to initialize all your member variables to some safe value in a ctor, even if it's a trivial value such as NULL for pointers. Reasoning: the ordering of global object initialization is not guaranteed (globals includes static variables), so you may end up with code that seems to fail nondeterministically since it depends on object X being initialized before object Y.

Seamlessly logging in with OpenID requires automatic (unverified) redirection between domains. That makes the OpenID server a 3rd party. This can cause cookies for the OpenID server to be rejected if you turn off 3rd party cookies and your browser strictly follows the Unverifiable Transactions rule in 3.3.6 of RFC2965. An example of this is Opera. If you turn off 3rd party cookies (by setting the global to \"Accept only cookies from the site I visit\"), you can't log in with OpenID because the server script you submit to automatically (without your interaction to approve it) redirects you to the OpenID server and the OpenID server does the same to get you back. But, you get lucky in Firefox, IE and Safari with their corresponding blocking of 3rd party cookies because they violate RFC2965 in multiple situations. Having to use OpenID in this case does a disservice to more compliant clients. As a workaround, in Opera, besides accepting all cookeis, you can goto tools - preferences - advanced - Network and turn off Automatic Redirection. Then, you'll be able to verify and click each link you're redirected to and the cookies won't be rejected because the transactions are verified. It should also work if you keep Automatic Redirection on and both servers generate a page with a link for you to click on so you can verify the transaction. But, there can't be any automatic redirects anywhere. Logging in with just a username and password where you're only dealing with first party cookies would be much better in this case.

The only case where I think System.exit() makes sense is when your app is meant to be called by applications which are not Java and therefore have to use return codes to see if your app worked or not and you want those applications to have a chance to react differently on different things going wrong, i.e. you need different return codes.

It is important that while objects are stored in a hash table, they retain their hash value. To realize this it is often simplest to make hashable objects immutable, thus evading the whole problem. It is however sufficient to make only those fields immutable that determine the hash value.

Problems often occur when one thread does a \"check-then-act\" (e.g. \"check\" if the value is X, then \"act\" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the \"check\" and the \"act\". E.g: if (x == 5) // The \"Check\" { y = x * 2; // The \"Act\" // If another thread changed x in between \"if (x == 5)\" and \"y = x * 2\" above, // y will not be equal to 10. } The point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing. In order to prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the data at a time.

This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access. There's almost always a race condition when one thread calls sleep to give another thread time to finish a task (unless that sleep is in a loop, with some checking mechanism). Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals. Mutexes are good when you want to make sure you're the only one doing something. Signals are good when you want to make sure someone else has finished doing something.

Code which relies heavily on sleeps is prone to race conditions, so first check for calls to sleep in the affected code. Adding particularly long sleeps can also be used for debugging to try and force a particular order of events. This can be useful for reproducing the behavior, seeing if you can make it disappear by changing the timing of things, and for testing solutions put in place. The sleeps should be removed after debugging. The signature sign that one has a race condition though, is if there's an issue that only occurs intermittently on some machines.

This is a cryptographic hash and it isn't at all good for hash tables which you probably mean. Hash tables have very different requirements. But still, finding a good hash function universally is hard because different data types expose different information that can be hashed. As a rule of thumb it is good to consider all information a type holds equally. This is not always easy or even possible. For reasons of statistics (and hence collision), it is also important to generate a good spread over the problem space, i.e. all possible objects. This means that when hashing numbers between 100 and 1050 it's no good to let the most significant digit play a big part in the hash because for ~ 90% of the objects, this digit will be 0. It's far more important to let the last three digits determine the hash. Similarly, when hashing strings it's important to consider all characters – except when it's known in advance that the first three characters of all strings will be the same; considering these then is a waste.

Given a pair of message, m' and m, it is computationally infeasible to find two such that that h(m) = h(m') The two cases are not the same. In the first case, there is a pre-existing hash that you're trying to find a collision for. In the second case, you're trying to find any two messages that collide. The second task is significantly easier due to the birthday \"paradox.\" Where performance is not that great an issue, you should always use a secure hash function. There are very clever attacks that can be performed by forcing collisions in a hash. If you use something strong from the outset, you'll secure yourself against these. Don't use MD5 or SHA-1 in new designs. Most cryptographers, me included, would consider them broken. The principle source of weakness in both of these designs is that the second property, which I outlined above, does not hold for these constructions. If an attacker can generate two messages, m and m', that both hash to the same value they can use these messages against you. SHA-1 and MD5 also suffer from message extension attacks, which can fatally weaken your application if you're not careful. A more modern hash such as Whirpool is a better choice.

All that happens is the directory entry is removed, but this doesn't affect any other process that might still have the file open. The process with the file open hangs on to the inode, rather than to the directory entry.

The number of concurrent connections you can support equals the number of mongrels (or Passenger processes) in your cluster.

All of this is possible in pure code, monads just allow you to abstract it away and reuse it in modular libraries (always good in programming), as well as providing convenient syntax to make it look imperative. Haskell already has operator overloading[1]: it uses type classes much the way one might use interfaces in Java or C# but Haskell just happens to also allow non-alphanumeric tokens like + and > as infix identifiers. It's only operator overloading in your way of looking at it if you mean \"overloading the semicolon\" [2]. It sounds like black magic and asking for trouble to \"overload the semicolon\" (picture enterprising Perl hackers getting wind of this idea) but the point is that without monads there is no semicolon, since purely functional code does not require or allow explicit sequencing. This all sounds much more complicated than it needs to. sigfpe's article is pretty cool but uses Haskell to explain it, which sort of fails to break the chicken and egg problem of understanding Haskell to grok Monads and understanding Monads to grok Haskell. [1] This is a separate issue from monads but monads use Haskell's operator overloading feature.

I was working on a language parser, and needed to represent an AST in Python. This is certainly within the scope of what Python can do, but I had a bit of trouble with some refactoring. I was changing the representation of my AST and changing methods and classes around a lot, and I found I missed the strong typing that would be available to me in a C++ solution.

It's possible to write syntactically correct code in Python that simply won't run. The compiler is incapable of telling you about it until it actually executes the code, so in infrequently-used code paths such as error handlers you can easily have unseen bugs lurking around.

You could adapt your code thus:- using System.Threading; ... void Application_ThreadException(object sender, ThreadExceptionEventArgs e) { throw new ParserException(e.Exception.Message, e.Exception); } ... var exceptionHandler = new ThreadExceptionEventHandler(Application_ThreadException); Application.ThreadException += exceptionHandler; try { // Execution stopped at parser.prog() TimeDefParser.prog_return prog_ret = parser.prog(); return prog_ret == null ? null : prog_ret.value; } catch (Exception ex) { throw new ParserException(ex.Message, ex); } finally { Application.ThreadException -= exceptionHandler; } ","pontos":8},{"corpo":"You can set up VS.Net to break as soon as any exception occurs.

Just something simple like this: CREATE TRIGGER KeepUpdated on Profiles FOR UPDATE, INSERT AS UPDATE dbo.Profiles SET LastUpdate = GetDate() WHERE Username IN (SELECT Username FROM inserted) If you want to get really fancy, have it evaluate what's being changed versus what's in the database and only modify LastUpdate if there was a difference. Consider this... 7am - User 'jsmith' is created with a last name of 'Smithe' (oops), LastUpdate defaults to 7am 8am - 'jsmith' emails IT to say his name is incorrect. You immediately perform the update, so the last name is now 'Smith' and (thanks to the trigger) LastUpdate shows 8am 2pm - Your slacker coworker finally gets bored with StumbleUpon and checks his email. He sees the earlier message from 'jsmith' regarding the name change. He runs: UPDATE Profiles SET LastName='Smith' WHERE Username='jsmith' and then goes back to surfing MySpace. The trigger doesn't care that the last name was already 'Smith', however, so LastUpdate now shows 2pm. If you just blindly change LastUpdate whenever an update statement runs, it's TECHNICALLY correct because an update did happen, but it probably makes more sense to actually compare the changes and act accordingly. That way, the 2pm Update statement by the coworker would still run, but LastUpdate would still show 8am. --Kevin ","pontos":20},{"corpo":" \"Also, you can put some code in to catch all unhandled exceptions.

This used to catch all unhandled exceptions in .NET 1.0/1.1 but it was a bug and it wasn't supposed to and it was fixed in .NET 2.0. AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException Is only intended to be used as a last chance logging saloon so you can log the exception before the program exits. It wont catch the exception as of 2.0 onwards (although in .NET 2.0 at least there is a config value you can modify to make it act like 1.1 but it isn't recommended practice to use this.). Its worth noting that there are few exceptions that you cannot catch, such as StackOverflowException and OutOfMemoryException. Otherwise as other people have suggested it might be an exception in a background thread somewhere. Also I'm pretty sure you can't catch some/all unmanaged/native exceptions either.

","pontos":0},{"corpo":" Are there any general advice or workarounds for organizing or redistributing templated member definitions across multiple files? Yes; don't. The C++ spec permits a compiler to be able to \"see\" the entire template (declaration and definition) at the point of instantiation, and (due to the complexities of any implementation) most compilers retain this requirement. The upshot is that #inclusion of any template header must also #include any and all source required to instantiate the template. The easiest way to deal with this is to dump everything into the header, inline where posible, out-of-line where necessary. If you really regard this as an unacceptable affront, a common option is to split the template into the usual header/implementation pair, and then #include the implementation file at the end of the header. C++'s \"export\" feature may or may not provide another workaround. The feature is poorly supported and poorly defined; although it in principle should permit some kind of separate compilation of templates, it doesn't necessarily obviate the demand that the compiler be able to see the entire template body.

For protecting against SQL injection, don't do anything to the data itself. Just use prepared statements, and that way, you don't have to worry about messing with the data that the user entered, and having it negatively affect your logic. You have to sanitize a little bit, to ensure that numbers are numbers, and dates are dates, since everything is a string as it comes from the request, but don't try to do any checking to do things like block keywords or anything. For protecting against XSS attacks, it would probably be easier to fix the data before it's stored. However, as others mentioned, sometimes it's nice to have a pristine copy of exactly what the user entered, because once you change it, it's lost forever. It's almost too bad there's not a fool proof way to ensure you application only puts out sanitized HTML the way you can ensure you don't get caught by SQL injection by using prepared queries.

Further, the call stack must typically be recorded at the time of the exception being thrown; once it has been caught the stack has unrolled, so you no longer know what was going on at the point of being thrown.

If you want to combine a try/catch/finally and a using, you can either nest them: try { ... using ( MyThing thing = new MyThing() ) { ... } ... } catch ( Exception e ) { .... } finally { .... } (Or put the try/catch/finally in the using): using ( MyThing thing = new MyThing() ) { ... try { ... } catch ( Exception e ) { .... } finally { .... } ... } // thing.Dispose is called now Or you can unroll the and explicitly call in the block as @Quarrelsome demonstrated, adding any extra exception-handling or -recovery code that you need in the (or in the ).

You can take advantage of the optional parameter to specify custom sorting order (the alternative, using , is a deprecated solution, as it has to be evaluated multiple times - is only computed once per element). So, to sort according to the current locale, taking language-specific rules into account ( is a helper function from functools): sorted(mylist, key=cmp_to_key(locale.strcoll)) And finally, if you need, you can specify a custom locale for sorting: import locale locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US.UTF-8') # vary depending on your lang/locale assert sorted((u'Ab', u'ad', u'aa'), key=cmp_to_key(locale.strcoll)) == [u'aa', u'Ab', u'ad'] Last note: you will see examples of case-insensitive sorting which use the method - those are incorrect, because they work only for the ASCII subset of characters.
