Fail! /div /body /html There is one flaw with this, if the text is short enough to be fully displayed, the ellipses will still be displayed as well. [EDIT: 6/26/2009] At the suggestion of Power-Coder I have revised this a little. There are really only two changes, the addition of the doctype (see notes below) and the addition of the \"display: inline-block\" attribute on the qrytxt div. Here is what it looks like now... !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\" html head style div.sidebox { width: 25%; } div.sidebox div.qrytxt { height: 1em; line-height: 1em; overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; } div.sidebox div.qrytxt span.ellipsis { float: right; } /style /head body div class=\"sidebox\" div class=\"qrytxt\" span class=\"ellipsis\" hellip; /span Some long text which will arbitrarily be cut off at whatever word fits best but will have an ellipsis at the end. /div div class=\"qrytxt\" span class=\"ellipsis\" hellip; /span Some more long text which will arbitrarily be cut off at whatever word fits best but will have an ellipsis at the end. /div div class=\"qrytxt\" span class=\"ellipsis\" hellip; /span Short text. FTW /div /div /body /html Notes: Viewed in IE 8.0, Opera 9, FF 3 A doctype is required for IE to get the \"display: inline-block\" to work correctly. If the qrytxt div's overflow occurs on a long word, there is going to be a wide gap between the ellipsis and the last visible word. You can see this by viewing the example and resizing your browser width in small increments. (this probably existed in the original example as well, I just may have not noticed it then) So again, an imperfect CSS-only solution. Javascript may be the only thing that can get the effect perfect. [EDIT: 6/27/2009] Here is another alternative which uses browser specific extensions. !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\" html head style div.sidebox { width: 26%; } div.sidebox div.qrytxt { height: 1em; line-height: 1em; overflow: hidden; text-overflow:ellipsis; -o-text-overflow:ellipsis; -ms-text-overflow:ellipsis; -moz-binding:url(ellipsis-xbl.xml#ellipsis); white-space:nowrap; } /style /head body div class=\"sidebox\" div class=\"qrytxt\" Some long text which will arbitrarily be cut off at whatever word fits best but will have an ellipsis at the end. /div div class=\"qrytxt\" Some more long text which will arbitrarily be cut off at whatever word fits best but will have an ellipsis at the end. /div div class=\"qrytxt\" Short text. FTW /div /div /body /html Note that in order for the above example to work, you must create the xml file referenced by the -moz-binding rule, ellipsis-xbl.xml.
